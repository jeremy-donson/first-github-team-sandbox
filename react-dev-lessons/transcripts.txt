you came up with something smart on that whiny post of mine 😀
nice 󰀀
was my reply helpful?
I would like to learn more about vcurrency
as per its structure, design and function
Calixte Sim
Extremely helpful. I was actually looking at bit-coin documentation. Confused me a bit, but the structure in my opinion was nearly flawless. But on issue decentralization.
one*
Jeremy
is a diagram clarifying?
I make great ones.
Calixte Sim
Is this going to cost?
Jeremy
no
I am open source 100%
sorry not to be clear
might put my name on the diagram
but it is for all humans
Calixte Sim
So you are for this?
Jeremy
which this?
Calixte Sim
Bio-Coin.
Jeremy
that.which.this = that.this(bind);
:D
might need to be a little more specific
I have ideas for sharing that are cutting edge
separate what we can own from what cannot be owned
disclosure with the latter is not a threat
articulating the question first might help....
how can you share a good idea with someone who you do not know and facilitate teamwork while not posing a threat to your own stake?
I am designing tools for this.
I have given it some thought. 🙂
NDA could assist, but that assumes that you are offering things that can be owned.
and I could trade ya a diagram for SOME disclosure
barter is nice
Calixte Sim
NDA? How far along are you into these projects?
Non-disclosure agreement
Jeremy
yes
Calixte Sim
but your are speaking of ideas?
Jeremy
mine?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
I know what can and cannot be owned of my projects.
so I am free to disclose that which cannot be owned anyway 🙂
takes time to bear out the distinctions for a given project
and my diagramming capabilities are hepful
Calixte Sim
Understood.
Jeremy
you are pretty sharp for florida
howd that happen?
Calixte Sim
So, I am kind of a  little confused but maybe later things will be clearer.
Jeremy
I am always confused, and hopefully aware of it.  😀
Calixte Sim
Wow. Black and rejection from society would make you pick up books.
Jeremy
aha
nice
they had a good effect on ya
and I am picky
<listening>
you read the source code?
Calixte Sim
Ok, to keep on subject I am speaking of Bio-Coin.     Contracts can be built between individual based on an idea and entities can be built for that specific idea with the registration id from those two bio-coins. Two coins(people) created one  entity.
Jeremy
and we met in a tech group?
how about we crit bitcoin first?
off the cuff?
is it the precursor?
is it broken?
why?
does it work?
how/why?
etc
be candid
helps me get to know ya
Calixte Sim
and the income and decision on finical would need to be keyed in by those two individual.
financial.
Jeremy
And if you would prefer that I chat in larger blocks, can do.  Many prefer that.
Calixte Sim
critique bitcoin cool.
it is slow is fuck
Jeremy
well, let's look at implementation first
is speed the driving criteria?
I prefer to fuck long and slow 😀
lol
Calixte Sim
as*
Jeremy
I read ya right.  <nods>
Calixte Sim
Yes honestly, instance gratification is really nice.
People love it.
Jeremy
well, I see that selling point
and it is a way to sell it
but I am more interested in terms of design that pertain to quality over speed
not saying you are wrong
we can sell that too
but faster aint better
it is just faster
same faster
Calixte Sim
True
Jeremy
we are not disagreeing
many ways to slice this potato
all are yummy
I am older.
a young 50
and I have seen what speed means
wrong faster?
:D
I am more tuned into quality things.
It seems to bear out higher quality and then speed is also juicy too.
so, you can say !!wtf!
and ask for an example
np
the distributed model
Calixte Sim
understood
Jeremy
the pace of a transaction
the RATE-DETERMINING-STEPs of the set-leap-spike of the transaction
I am old DBA
transactions are multi-step
and the rate determining step is that which dictates the speed of the overall execution
works in chem and sofwtare
many would speed up the faster steps
and the rate-determining -step would still be the same 😮
that would not improve performance
are transactions executed in sequence or in parallel?
Calixte Sim
they would have to be executed i parallel
in(
in*
Jeremy
that can raise certain issues
in database world
ACID compliance is worth reading about
ATOMIC
CONSISTENT
INTEGRITY
DURABLE
Calixte Sim
Your speaking of intergrity
Jeremy
all have payoffs
sorry

howzat for a case-in-point?
Calixte Sim
Is there any way we can have a whiteboard online that both of use can view? Or document structure?
Jeremy
yes
get an account at cacoo.com
and they will give us a few free docs for 2 weeks
and then share them into the account I have forever from them
back when they started they gave me lifetime account with 30 docs
so start doc there, share with me and I can keep forever
cacoo.com
I will draw

jjdonson@gmail.com
glad you see the value of a good diagram
words suck 😀
lol
phone and diagramming might get us there?
glad to put into writing that the diagram is 51% yours if you wanna own the results
not sure it CAN be owned, but that might help ya loosen up?
just a thought <shrug>
Calixte Sim
True enough. Before I go and do the listed steps. I was wondering if you would be interested in mentoring me ? Honestly, I am not looking for money in this project. Just knowledge.
Jeremy
barter
we can barter
51% yours
Calixte Sim
Cool?
Cool.
Jeremy
and bartering around that works fine
what languages do you use?
and what OS do you run locally?
Calixte Sim
I can use pretty much any language, I think. As long as there is documentation. But I have a code grasp on the LAMP stack. I have used C,JAVA and python in courses but nothing beyond that. I am running Windows OS.
code=good
Jeremy
ok cool
I am on OS X, but windows and linux-savvy
I know lots about linux and hardware and databases in general.
And I am learning react.js and express.js.

So issue with know your customer.  A problem with BitCoin but this article says. Has solved it with Biometrics. Yes I see it.

Calixte Sim
Critiques for bitcoin:
Which blockchain-based cryptocurrency has the fastest transactions times?
Answer (1 of 8): This is a little premature, but the answer is going to be in a Layer 2 service like Raiden or Lightning when it launches. Blockchains have a natural upper limit of 10 tx a second, with some designs able to get up to 1,000 tx in theory (Ripple and Stellar being two of these). La...
quora.com
Just saying maybe we can build a service on top of a chain that is just faster and skip the bottom up approach.
Jeremy
I will read them all
https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+diagram&oq=bitcoin+diagram&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5318j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
are any helpful?
what would we like our diagrams to "say"?
about bitcoin?
about blockchain?
2 diagrams?
Calixte Sim
Well, I am going to have to take a deeper dive into bitcoin before I can say much of anything about it.Besides what I think is common knowledge but doesn't actually hurt the brand.
The link you shared to me was a bunch of noise. Sorry.
What are we building these two diagrams about?
Jeremy
to ask good questions
unambiguously
it was a link to google "bitcoin diagrams"
Calixte Sim
Understood
Jeremy
was on phone
using pre-existing diagrams can save time
Calixte Sim
No problem, I actually have to go. Actual work that I have to complete for a client. Will write back with good question. Main one do we actually need miners if they will be obsolete eventually? If not why are we wasting resources to mine towards a constant number for commerce?
Jeremy
well, you raise a very important issue that I feel is paramount
but not for now if you need to do
Calixte Sim
Talk to to you later.

P.S When is the best time to contact you.

JAN 16TH, 7:06PM

k, will read those and comment
JAN 16TH, 8:42PM
Jeremy
k yeah
I get it
and I agree
well done
how to distribute the technology required for all that biometrics?
and how to beat those who will try to crack that system?
technically
and strategically
and iteratively
WED 7:05AM
Jeremy
Any interest in react/express dev?
And let's schedule a call about bitcoin and "authCoin"?
WED 8:24AM
Jeremy
I have been reading up.
A diagram for blockchain and for bitcoin are both worth discussing to help us discuss auth.
The auth workflow is definitely not simply a nice to have.  Tis mandatory.
Jeremy
I have two projects in the works.

The second one would be a great way to create a work-backed vcurrency.

Not speculative.
No mining needed.

Just literally sweat equity.
Perhaps we can negotiate for being mutual stakeholders?
WED 4:47PM
Jeremy
Where do you usually deploy apps?
I am about to start deploying react.js and express.js apps to a few places.
Calixte Sim
Hello, hopefully all is well.
When you ask "where", do you mean my location or Dev Env?
And  react and angular are both on my list of frameworks to learn.
What is "authCoin"?
I agree with you authentication workflow is mandatory.I actually been wrestling with it all day in my head. How do you authenticate transactions (really the creation of coins without mining/proof of work)?
But I guess you have a solution with your second project?
Jeremy
I am learning react and maybe you ought to jump into what I am doing so you get the momentum.  I have been doing react for about 6 weeks, heavily.
host apps, like aws, gcloud, heroku, etc
authCoin is what I would call what you call bioCoin
the idea is that is secure, and it ought to matter not HOW
nFactorAuth
methods undisclosed 🙂
tiers of auth are good
like not EVERYONE needs eye scan, but if warranted, it is supported, etc
I am just about to start deploying to a bunch of places with some react apps:
- ghub
- heroku
- surge
- tectonic
- gcloud
and I wabt to add express to react
want ^
React is the easiest to learn and the most in demand
express can do amazing things on server side with VERY little code
I have examples that will floor ya
how are ya?
<listening>
one thing I really need is a better debugging approach to react.js
I would like to dump ALL vars, funcs, arrays, objects.
Calixte Sim
Agreed, again certain hardware will not be available everywhere.So tiers of authentication sounds great. However reading from articles iris scans can be hacked so can passwords and fingerprints. So we have to actually strengthen bio-metrics to really start speaking of security once compromised bio-metrics is essentially useless.
Jeremy
https://medium.com/denizandvlad/keeping-your-crypto-coins-safe-dcb356026fc2
Look at yubico
Calixte Sim
In regards to your current project. I am always up for a new project. So just tell me what I need to get started.
Jeremy
react debugging tools are key
I can set ya up with all else
I have a resume which is a react app that I want to deploy
need to set absolute paths for it
the faster we get to express.js the better
http://mern.io/
MERN v2.0 - Build production ready universal apps easily
MERN is a scaffolding tool which makes it easy to build universal apps using Mongo, Express, React, NodeJS, Redux and Webpack. It minimizes the setup time and gets you up to speed using proven technologies.
mern.io
I use bitbucket for private repos and github for public ones
and if you can help out with react debugging, we will want to:
- debug easily, like all that is in the cache
- use bitbucket and github to collaborate
- deploy to somewhere we like
- start using express asap, where I have example that you will love
what runs your laptop
?
linux osx win?
Calixte Sim
win
Jeremy
k
do you use git and github?
I would suggest that you install this:  http://gitforwindows.org/

And get free accounts at bbucket and ghub.

And we ought to start to rummage thru existing bitcoin and blockchain diagrams and see what we like.
Git for Windows
We bring the awesome Git VCS to Windows
gitforwindows.org
Calixte Sim
doing now
Jeremy
For linux-y binary mgt on win:  scoop.sh
I use something called brew on osx.
(y)
brew : osx as scoop : win.
once you have scoop installed, you will use it to install node:

$ scoop install node

Between git and scoop, you are able to get all you need running local.
node is server-side js
it comes with node package manager
$ git clone [github-repo-url]
or
$ scoop install node
or
$ npm install webpack
those will be your local installers
first lesson is to get create-react-app installed and use it:

$ scoop install node
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ create-react-app firstApp
$ cd firstApp
$ npm start

Then browse to localhost:3000
You should see empty react app.
Then we will start to deploy that.
Then we start to dockerize and deploy that.

Then we get debugging tools.
Then I can show you how to use git and github.

Then we can get started with a project.
Feel free to give me a call and review by phone:  718-710-9434
Glad to jumpstart ya.
best would be to define goals and schedule meetings
no worries is that is a load to digest
you can let me know what you know and what is new
np
Calixte Sim
At least you understand, it is quite a load. Im still on gitWindow
Jeremy
of course
hey
git4win includes all kinds of GREAT shit
ssh
bash
all kinds of linux binaries
and of course, git
creating some shortcuts to get to bash prompt and run git from bash is recommended
It is all kosher.
gimme a call and I will help ya thru it
I need to free up my hands to code
if you do not use git and github then that is something we can swim ya thru in 30m within a day
meanwhile, install scoop, and use it to install node (which should include npm)

Then use npm to install create-react-app

And get a react app running, and we can deploy it,
and then we can go back and make ya feel more oriented locall.
you just got bonused 😀
glad to
Calixte Sim
Thank you
Jeremy
this is how we can collab solid
np
yo owe me, and I will not ask for much
I promise
lets get ya useful with that stuff
I would like to work at a bitcoin corp in nyc.
Then I will really know the internals of vcurrency.
so, jumpstarting ya to get to useful with git, github, react, is all just required prep
and I am already solid there
so enjoy
Calixte Sim
downloading scoop now
Jeremy
you will be jazzed
Calixte Sim
will ping once completed everything
Jeremy
cool
scoop installs node, which comes with npm

npm installs create-react-app

create-react-app installs react boiler plate, which is react node prefab app

then test locally

then we can deploy to a couple of place
s
ask anything
no prob at all
you will find that I often speak in bash
Calixte Sim
Ok done with some now npm and node.js
some=scoop
Jeremy
just install node
it should include npm
https://www.npmjs.com/package/scoop/tutorial
This says to install npm direct.
You still ought to use scoop when you can.
See if it will install node and npm
that would be best
that link is fallback *if* you get blacked
Calixte Sim
understood
Scoop on update
Jeremy
nice
git clone

scoop install

npm install -g
those are how you get local running now
git is the most complex

we can push that to the end
Calixte Sim
it says it couldn't find manifest for node.
Jeremy
then use the node installer in that link
abd I bet npm can install scoop
then when you wanna run something linuxy, you can install it with scoop
I just know those three are all y'need and then some on win
react and node get updated all the time
they are a blur
Calixte Sim
I hate frameworks to be honest for that reason.
Jeremy
yes, we will talk
I agree and understand
honesty is good
pruning out what we do not need will be something we get to soon
meanwhile, for dev and initial deploys, we ought to use frameworks and boilerplates
dockerize => deploy to tectonic
then we can go back and beat on the dev tools
get a github id while you run installs
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
(y)
get one at bitbucket.org of same name and password
bitbucket for private
github for public
if we can get ya deploying, and then installing express, I will blow ya away with an express app that will make you laugh and cry
2 pages of code does a TON
react for DOM state
express for backend logic

MERN stack is very nice
E = express
R = React
angular kept changing too fast and too much
react is tight
Calixte Sim
installing react now.
Are you saying angular is not worth learning?
actually creating the app
Jeremy
angular competes with react directly
and express as well
tries to do too much
each version is BIG change
react and express are separate for a reason
and they marry  up well
biggest demand is also for react
those are the facts that pushed me from angular to react
the criteria is the key
decision is personal
Calixte Sim
How long should an app install take?
Jeremy
create-react-app ?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
it takes a couple of minuts
longer than it should <nods>
the build step when deploying prunes out what is not used
Calixte Sim
the install did not give me a complete message. I have a file and a folder in the directory. Is it installed? It is node_modules folder and a json file. Or should I reinstall it?
Jeremy
should be more than that

the template is in public
the react code is in src
$ create-react-app firstApp
should have worked
Calixte Sim
reinstalling now
Jeremy
cool
for express:

$ npm install -g express-generator
oh, since windows
reboot
Calixte Sim
after install everything?
Jeremy
if you did not after installing node, you might
well, win is like that
deep installs can require reboot
Calixte Sim
i installed react successfully
now express
Jeremy
cool
Calixte Sim
done
Jeremy
yeah, express is lean
Calixte Sim
noticed
Jeremy
$ create-react-app firstApp
completed ok?
you have src/ dir in there?
like screenshot above
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
cool
cd in
$ npm start
then localhost:3000 in browser
templating system that is now stardard is called pug, fyi
react and express both use it
Calixte Sim
Pug is an abbreviation for?
Jeremy
no clue
perhaps like the dog?
used to be jade, now it is pug
just pointing out that both express and react can be separate
or togother
deploying that react app is nice next move
tomorrow we get ya using git and github
then we can dive in
and if you are up for it, the express app that I am blown away by from 2 pages of code
Calixte Sim
I can't wait. the localhost enviroment is running
I honestly can't wait
Jeremy
lol
you see react app running?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
good
glad you are psyched
going to deploy next is wise
else you can get jazzed with dev and never see a deploy
Calixte Sim
I don't understand.
Jeremy
we should push that app to heroku
or surge
or or somewhere it can get approved prior to aws or gcloud
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
running on dev only is a mirage
deploy = no mirage
Calixte Sim
understood
Jeremy
so, how about surge and heroku
no $
then you have a path to deploy from jump
and we can start to share code
and I can do git and github goodness tomorrow
Calixte Sim
ok ill deploy on surge now
Jeremy
nice
Calixte Sim
done
Jeremy
cool
Calixte Sim
I assume you are busy, I have to leave myself. I guess we will speak tomorrow.
Jeremy
well, that was good start, no?
Calixte Sim
Disregard
yes it was
Jeremy
great
time well spent
tomorrow we can do some git and github
then some express and some project planning
then you are in deep 🙂
please look into debugging in react
I would like to dump ALL vars, arrays objects
ALL
so we see all that is in the cache
then easy to debug anything
console.log(blah);
is selective
I want superset of options.
likely a node.js tool
same will be true for express
Calixte Sim
ok. Ill be reading up on that tonight. dump all data types into cache, correct?
Jeremy
yip
it is a node.js thing
that would cover react and express in one tool
Calixte Sim
Ok will do.
Jeremy
nice
thx
Calixte Sim
np, ttyl

THU 5:18AM
Jeremy
https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/09/25/debug-node-js/
THU 6:19AM
Jeremy
Good morning.

Next steps for us are to:
- expose ALL cache elements with debugging
- use that to expose absolute component and image paths at surge
- add a png image to react app
- add an svg image to react app
- implement custom react components
- implement custom properties
- create a phone app using react native
- consider finding a web site for vcurrency where we can improve it
- look at redux to eval best tools for web routing
- take a look at express.js
- deploy express.js apps
Jeremy
I would prefer that we break that into chunks, and schedule it.
THU 7:27AM
Jeremy
my core team:
- trainers of git and github
- react and express devs
- librarians
- radio, tv and live venue managers
- sponsorship engineers
they will all need each other's help 🙂
morning
Calixte Sim
Good morning,
I haven't solved the cache issue. Looked at some threads that seemed useful, but I am still new to react so I am complete clueless for now. Figured out how the components portion of it works. But it seems that you cannot use standard css, is this true?
That is a large team. What is this team for exactly?
Jeremy
no worries
just listing the issues
this team is for my 2 main projects
linkedUp
barterEngine
Calixte Sim
care to elaborate  on barterEngine
?
Jeremy
both projects are near term in terms of momentum
linkedUp will USE barterEngine
barterEngine could leverage vcurrency
Calixte Sim
Not to bother but I was looking for more details like: What is it's purpose?, How will it leverage vcurrency? and how can I fit in this puzzle?
Jeremy
yeah, that one is quite proprietary
I love the curiosity.
And as we get into vcurrency, you will be given more.
but only as needed
linkedUp is open source
and I am being generous there
Calixte Sim
😰
Jeremy
lol
nah
Calixte Sim
np
Jeremy
you will know more than most
as needed
and you can have a stake
just gotta keep that one secure
Calixte Sim
understood.
Jeremy
the team for vcurrency is not even considered yet
we are "it" 😉
Calixte Sim
Ok.
Jeremy
that ought to help
anyone else who gets considered for team is disclosed to you
Calixte Sim
Well allow me to get familiar with React syntax for a moment I can't even create a simple CRUD app yet.
Jeremy
yeah, it is different
read-only first
lots of ui goodies to play with first
then play with state
then forms are easy
I am a GREAT trainer.
And I  have done the trudging thru many tools and vids and docs.
Calixte Sim
So I will just read the documentation.
Jeremy
nah
follow that list
we will refer to docs
but examples are best
you might also need pip installed, fyi
we installed most package managers needed yesterday
do you run python 3?
and debugging tools first or crud will drive ya bonkers, lol
just let me pave the road, and you can drive
then we get to vcurrency faster
Calixte Sim
yes I do run python 3.
Jeremy
nice
Calixte Sim
ok <listening>
Jeremy
pip3 is helpful for installs as well
just wanted to be sure:
- npm
- git
- scoop
 - pip3
those round out your session yesterday
installers
debugging tools are next
there MUST be a node call that simply dumps all vars, arrays, objects from cache
Calixte Sim
I have pip installed, checking for updates
Jeremy
well, now when you are given x to install, you will have the installer
datz all
note that with npm...
$ npm install -g blah
vs
$ npm install blah
the top one is global install for system packages
bottom on is local to a project only
Calixte Sim
understood
Jeremy
cool\
package.json file is updated with:

$ npm install blah --save
as in, we just installed package blah into project, and it is also now in the inventory for the project
why git?
even solo local without github use, git is awweeeewome
with github, it is dangerous in a good way
git is VERY small binary
Calixte Sim
dangerous 🙂
Jeremy
Linus Torwalds create is to manage his source code while he was CREATING linux.
way
it ^
Linus Torwalds create git to manage his source code while he was CREATING linux.
he kept trying different things
and often he needed to go back and try a new direction with code that he abandoned
or thought he had
git makes that simple
only in the last 10-12 years has git been popular
prior to that many vcs (versioning source code) tools existed...
cvs
perforce
bazaar
svn
visual source safe
then one came out that was web-aware
it was called mercurial
hg
it was for distributed team dev
and the idea of ditsributed code versioning was born
Calixte Sim
ok
<listening>
Jeremy
then someone named Scott Chacon took the git source code and added some features of mercurial to git
and git won
and then github came out
and git won again
it is THE de facto standard for distributed code mgt
the language used is not relevant
all use git
ALL
so, tuning windows people on to it and github requires some faith and awareness
best coder even without git and github could be assed out of the best projects
ever ^
so, end of rant
but now you know WHY git
Calixte Sim
yep
Jeremy
git is easy to use locally
as an installer, it works like this:
$ git clone GITHUB-URL
cd new-project-dir
$ npm install
That installs everything that is in package.json 🙂
this allows github repos to just list inventory and leave packages up to the deployers.
no worries if not crystal clear yet
but this ties together git and npm
$ git clone GITHUB-URL
$ cd project-dir
$ npm install
juicy
<nods>
now, before we even do anything crud-ly
take a look at what I found and got blessed by a node guru I really respect.
He wrote the lynda.com node training courses.
http://reactstrap.github.io/
reactstrap - React Bootstrap 4 components
reactstrap - easy to use React Bootstrap 4 components compatible with React 0.14.x and 15
reactstrap.github.io
no crud
but plenty of ui functional goodness
and all VERY nicely integrating bootstrap, which is responsive and cross-browser with react
Even playing with that, debugging becomes crucial.
I have used several.
I am not front end guy, but I can make nice diagrams in illustrator, and save as svg.
are ya hip to svg imagery and why it is best?
png is nice, but bitmap
svg is vector, so one image can be any size
resolution-independent
there are some ui things to check out first
Calixte Sim
yes I am I also have used illustrator and photoshop
Jeremy
cool
yah, I do not draw, but I know them well
since the early days
svg is bad ass
and it is supported by MOST recent browsers
https://caniuse.com/#feat=svg
so, browser support and debugging gets with react comes first
then we can do crud without causing ourselves undue pain
Calixte Sim
ok. LOL
Jeremy

glad to make the case
you dont know me
and you have your own perspective
but I will make compelling cases
and you can respond candidly
when people disagree respectfully, we all learn the most
Calixte Sim
I will not hesitate.
Jeremy
I get that 😀
I am good with it.
remember, we might BOTH be wrong.
:D
I was wrong once.
IT HURT!  😉
lol
Calixte Sim
Just once?
Jeremy
sarcasm
I was never wrong!
(sarcasm)
:D
lol
just keeping it lively
I invite varied perspectives.
They simply need to be informed, and then I can learn a lot as well.
So, reactstrap and gets is plenty.
And one thing I see is that deploys can fail due to:
- too long in deploy build
- relative paths which work in dev failing in public deploys
this is where debugger would be nice.
I would also like to use .htaccess type of method with node
so that we can deploy publicly and keep web site private without site-wide login
those would enhance our velocity with all projects
and you just showed up
we could try to work thru one together
your call

Calixte Sim
Where do we start

https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/09/25/debug-node-js/
Debugging Node.js – Three Options
Comparing the built-in Node debugger, Node Inspector, and IDEs for debugging Node.js apps.
spin.atomicobject.com
there
debugging targets:

1. gets
2.  absolute paths
global cache dump is best
and I have a fb group where I have been dumping links
I will add you to two groups
k?
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
(y)
https://www.facebook.com/groups/webdevui/
OSS Web UI Standards
164 members
join
1 more coming
https://www.facebook.com/groups/osswebdevbackend/
Open Source Web Dev & Engineering
583 members
join them both
some of our exchanges will be posted in there
not too much, but some
This looks juicy
http://xyc.github.io/react-inspector/
so get messy with debugging options
and we will work together
Calixte Sim
what ide do you use with react?
Jeremy
oh, great question
using the browser to debug is best
as not all devs will use same ide
but Visual Source Code is what I foud most react-savvy
sorry
Visual Studio Code
I bet you can install that with scoop
https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/blob/master/vscode.json
lukesampson/scoop-extras
scoop-extras - "Extras" bucket for Scoop
github.com
this suggests that I am correct in that regard
but I would not get too crazy with ide yet
start with browser-based debugging for all devs
do not impose an ide on others
make sense?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
then if someone who uses eclipse wants to join our effort, we are able to show them how to debug without making them change ide
cool
after we do debugging in browser, you make a good point
better to see problem first in IDE <nods>
those actually converge, and browser first is best
(y)
you are gleaning from me in two days what took me a LONG time 😀
stick with reactstrap and debugging, and you will find that you will avoid a lot of wasted time that I wish I had avoided
and then crud is in hand
Do you have a linkedin profile?
And can you get github and bitbucket id's?
Calixte Sim
I got them yesterday.
Jeremy
what are those id's?
Calixte Sim
username is simeoncalixte
for both
Jeremy
gotcha
thx
Calixte Sim
negative for LinkedIn, and I really do appreciate the help on this.
Jeremy
you are getting the good stuff
Calixte Sim
I will definitely pay your kindness forward
Jeremy
understood
it is not much to do to set someone up if they will trust and go
this is "implicit" barter
barterEngine is for explicit barter
you have been invited to a github repo
Calixte Sim
accepted
Jeremy
nice
you will first work locally
and then you can clone that repo and interact with me there
it is public repo
we can create conflicts, repair them, avoid them
three levels to git/github skills:
- solo local
- solo remote
- team remote
while we do debug things, we can keep snippets in that repo.
ok, I gotta get to work
ask me for help or guidance
I use chrome browser
firefox may have better debugging tools
we want node level debugging
express and react both use node
and we will jump into react-native as well
then we are well-tooled
Calixte Sim
ok, great chat, ttyl
Jeremy

that ought to be where we keep things that ought not to get lost in chat.

THU 12:34PM
Jeremy
yo
question
when you have 2m
Calixte Sim
Go ahead
Jeremy
in the interest of aiming towards crud
I am sticking to our current sequence
and asking early....
two types of state machines to start?
- csv
- redis
ok?
Jeremy
The art and science of workflow analytics is very organic and powerful.

It applies everywhere that humans interact in any way we can imagine.

Most of human interaction has not been properly considered in terms of basic workflow analytics.

It is important to understand that EVERY business and school and organization have workflows.

And they can be supported with software
And the workflows can be broken, and so can the tools.

Tons of software out there.

The art and science of workflow analytics requires a firm grip on:

1. Costs of broken workflows.
- Direct and indirect costs.
- To whom.
- How.

2. Clarity thru diagramming with regard to what is actually wrong with the workflow.

ALL workflow goals MUST be clearly spelled out.

3. Clarity thru diagramming with regard to what is actually broken.

4. Clarity thru diagramming with regard to what actually could be fixed.

5.  Challenges to that set of enhancements, from strategy to politics to implementations.
Jeremy
and that is about my work
https://redislabs.com/lp/node-js-redis/
And that is about which redis connector from react or express app.
:D
I am database engineer.
but simplest state machines first, k?
http://instantrimshot.com/index.php?sound=downer&play=true
Calixte Sim
Familiar with CSV
Jeremy
That was for dramatic effect 😉
lol
it is a good start
redis is key value store
SUPER ease
GREAT for authentication
VERY fast
dont hold back now
;)
Calixte Sim
I am not, reading your messages for clarity
Jeremy
I was being sarcastic
You are candid, and that is good.
take your time
quality takes time <nods>
aint nuttin on fire!
aint no pop quiz!
lol
Calixte Sim
Jeremy
(y)
alright!
I can be funny!
Calixte Sim
Ok, well ill have to read redis documentation as well. We will use redis..
Jeremy
nah
I can run ya thru it hands on in 10m
just giving you confidence that we will get to crud
cuz we will !!!!!!!!!!!!
Calixte Sim
From what I can see fuck yeah we will.
Jeremy
stick to sequence at play
oya
damn straight BayBEEEEE 😀
giving you clues to the future should not take you out of sequence
just gives you a sense of the trajectory
(y)
Calixte Sim
Understood
Jeremy
cool
if distracting, can hold off
your call
Calixte Sim
no go ahead as long as you're free
Jeremy
like:

"Yo Jeremy!

My head is already full!
I am TRYING to stay focused!
HELP me stay focused!
"
just asking
and also using this as a chance to reinforce the sequence
deploys and debugs and ui first
then we can get all about state
Calixte Sim
You are just clearing a lot of noise in my head. I read about redis before but never used it. So bring on the clarity!
Jeremy
good
that is the goal
you make good points
I say yes, and then put them in good sequence for us both.
Calixte Sim
Ok
Jeremy
https://github.com/jeremy-donson/first-github-team-sandbox/blob/master/README.md
reload page
I will not change sequence
but I will keep that sequence ahead of us a bit
like, 2-3 days ahead in terms of planning
then you always know what is coming
THU 8:24PM
Jeremy
ok, added some links, which we can test together
the testing is KEY
check the github repo readme (reload)
how yoo doon?
at your convenience
just notifying you of updates
Calixte Sim
Dude i am lost on setup
Jeremy
how so?
dude
that sounds painful
speak up
no solo pain!
if you want me to test something on win, speak up.
(!!)
<listening>
you flyin solo without a parachute? 😉
Calixte Sim
Sorry, react works fine. Im just paralyzed, on inserting the data into cache in the first place. Using php it was mostly done for you.
Jeremy
np
yes, do not worry about state yet
it is a PAIN in the ass, but nice once you learn it
and debug issues are PARAMOUNT
Calixte Sim
If you can't debug you cannot deploy
Jeremy
well, this is crucial we CAN debug
then question is not whether, but how
Calixte Sim
Exactly
Jeremy
and I provided some links to clue us in that way
Calixte Sim
Preciously?
Jeremy
?
what my precious?  😉

testing is the rub
lol, k
for example, how can we prove that whole all is exposed?
not hope
PROVE?
sans exceptions
so I will throw some methods at ya
but the terms of testing are paramount
not, HEY!  😀
this LOOKS like is works!  😀
no
how can we be certain
?!
and I have ideas, but this remains good first effort
terms of testing and debugging first
else DAYS will be lost without justification
and that will not do
bitcoin, or shitcoin?  😉
lol
Calixte Sim
Lol
Jeremy
so you will find me to be a bulldog about debugging and testing
else we are gluttons for punishment
and not good for biz
what is testing sufficiency?
I dunno!
how do we test for that too?
:D
funny, and totally serious
Calixte Sim
That I know.
Jeremy
go slow, and stick to the sequence
this is why I set that up
sequence came from PAIN
and wasted time!
spare yourself the redo
skip that crap
forget get and post until AFTER the debugging is ROCK solid
then it will be cake
else not (understatement)
and this is a node thing
not about react
just node
and you are welcome to prove it to yourself
Calixte Sim
Ok how do i get started with node? Of course, read the docs right.
Jeremy
yeah
node language stuff
Calixte Sim
Trust me , i trust your word
Jeremy
well, you can show me something good
and I will readily admit it
https://blog.codeship.com/understanding-garbage-collection-in-node-js/
relevant 󰀀
but not conclusive
so when I change sequence and let you know
shift sequence with me after asking why
sorry i did not have that right earlier
now it is better <shrug>
Calixte Sim
Ok now it makes since. I'm extremely slow.      😪
Jeremy
nope
this took me weeks to deduce
no
you aint
be nice to yourself
you are doing fine
great, really
https://github.com/jeremy-donson/first-github-team-sandbox/blob/master/README.md

you can ALWAYS ask why THAT sequence?

ALWAYS
as in, why this after that?
Calixte Sim
<currently read> and understood
Reading
Jeremy
tell me what you find
I have not read them
I am foraging and paving
when you like what you read, tell me to read that one

Calixte Sim
Im sure with your experience you are aware of garbage collection and the possibilities for memory leaks. It was basically letting us know that node.js tries its best to perform gc but developers need to be aware of instances where they may structure code that may prevent the engine behide node.js from collecting unused varibles. For example,  like haphazardly referencing global variables in functions can prevent V8 from collecting, but nothing about caching.
Calixte Sim
Or is gc part of caching?
Jeremy
gc is how the cache gets cleared
ie when memory is released, how to let go of what it held onto?
var g = 5;
there is a place in physical memory where that exists now.
when unset, how is that phsyical piece of ram reclaimed?
that is gc
clarifying?
Calixte Sim
Understood
Jeremy
did I address your question?
Calixte Sim
Yes.
Jeremy
cool
reclaimed chronologically?
by size, largest first?
etc
LRU = least recently used
many ways to order that queue
linear?
in parallel?
etc
Calixte Sim
Jeremy
lol, just posing the right questions
and the real question is when cache is dumped in full, how can we know we got it ALL?
it will not include garbage not yet collected
I have ideas for tests
but the questions need to be clear first
no rush
its good for ya
just reread and try to imagine it graphically
what is dirty cache?
stuff not yet collected
that ought to NOT be in active cache (clean)
and gc clears dirty cache
Calixte Sim
Ok im going to read more on node to get it up in running.
Fyi. I am approaching as though i would be working PHP. Since both are server-side languages.

Dirty cache is ones that fit the parameters mentioned above?
Are*
Jeremy
three section of mem:
- in cache
- dirty and on its way out via gc
- free
yes every language has htis
it a language agnostic thang
1 => 2 via unset var/object/etc
2 => 3 via gc
3 => 1 via set
three section of mem:
1 - in cache
2 - dirty and on its way out via gc
3 - free
Calixte Sim
So the methods given on stackoverflow does not help?
With your problem I mean.
Jeremy
they are partial
not all
globals
that aint all that we can set
native and custom
globals and local
Calixte Sim
Ok, clearer.  <reading node.js>
Jeremy
nice
frankly HOW it gets cleared can be complex
we simply want to know all in cache
and a memory leak would be when dirty is not collected
or when unset is not marked as dirty ready for collection
that ought to clear the critical path somewhat
like can we get a dump of all in cache, and resource cost of each?
and see what is free mem?
and make sure that all adds up?
that would be nice accounting
Calixte Sim
From what I've read no, which is from the link you shared.
Jeremy
well, first we want a list
then we want accounting
then we are set
short of that, we are good with listr
Calixte Sim
👌.... Savali(in time)
THU 10:52PM
Calixte Sim
Well this is the last message of the night, I remember you telling between 6 a.m and 11 p.m, https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cache is a cache system. Are you using it maybe the functions might make it easier on your situation let me know what you think?
I cannot imagine it not returning everything that it contains
Get multiple keys (MGET):
if I am in the wrong place. Please redirect me back on the right path.
myCache.keys( [callback] )
Returns an array of all existing keys.
Also we never defined whether which cache system you were using, that all would of helped?
whether or not*
Good night 🌙
FRI 7:12AM
Jeremy
hey good morning
I am always up very early
scheduling some time would be best
That is like memcached, which is an ALT cache
I am asking guru today.
lets try to schedule some meeting/working times over next few weeks.
And I will start to share code into the repo.
We need to getya up on git and github, and start to deal with absolute paths and deployments.
This implements the map() function.
Jeremy
To the guru:

Three areas of node cache:
- occupied: From which we want full dump!!
- dirty: From which garbage collection cleans
- free: which is used for new declarations and assignments

When I saw full dump:
- constants
- variables
- arrays
- objects
- functions
- etc

And also their resource costs, as well.
Jeremy
Occupied + Dirty + Free  should total complete node memory?

And all names with resource costs would permit memory accounting?
Jeremy
This will only work by scheduling and planning going forward.

Can we get into a regular pattern of learn and work sessions?
Jeremy
We ought to review the sequence I laid out on that github readme together?
Best done on a phone call.

Several tools to learn:
1. git/github/bitbucket
2. deployment issues
3. react ui and debug
4. react redis+csv
4. react forms
5. react-native??

Several projects:
1. web app resume
2. team dev dojo
3. linkedUp
4. barterEngine
5. vcurrency
Jeremy
I feel I ought to be a bit exacting and enforce some scheduling polcies.
I already wasted too much time solo without clear path of learning and working.
Please start using phone and scheduling time and verifying what your action items are.
FRI 8:29AM
Calixte Sim
Understood. You are my senior so whatever schdule works for you is fine by me. 7868001492 is my number.  I am at work between 8:30 to 5 p.m but it is family business so basically I am almost always free.
Jeremy
ok, good to know
thx
the goals is to become equals
and you get to pay back with some teaching and onboarding of other devs who are bound by contract to barter
and then you will get a feel for the barter thing
Calixte Sim
Would you like to use google calendar to share you schedule, or should I share mine?
np, I have extreme patient when I want to learn and master something, and this is one area that I have dedicated to much to to look back now.
patience*

Brb...
We'll chat a 930.

Jeremy
And we ought to set a topic list prior.
And assume that we will end up with action items at the end, and a sched for next meeting.
Then it is a process, iterative, etc.
We will smooth that out, np.
(iteratively) . 😉
Jeremy

Topic? Well, one is cache debugging, since it is first on the list.Which cache engine are you using? That was the question I ended with last night. Should of been asked a lot earlier, but I was wondering if that was intentional.

should we set up some tests cases and test runs so we can record results?

Key that we start doing that asap.

And reproducibility of test and test result is the measure of quality.
Calixte Sim
I though it was the goal of this task?
Jeremy
well...
3 goals...
1. define the test case
2. define the test run
3.  execute and document test run and see if reproducible

One step at a time
complete what you can before execution first?
test-driven is worth doing right
(so is debugging)
we are killing two massive birds here, so go slow
App.js code which tests the package is also important to document, ya?
also worth throwing in that there are many sections to the App.js file:

1 imports
2. main class
3. constructor
4  pre-render
5. render
6, export
this will GREATLY simplify our efforts to learn react.js
imho each section needs explanation
and that is not in the docs
k, I added those sections of the App.js file to the readme
that saved us a LOT of wasted time too 🙂
Calixte Sim
Sorry as they end traffic picks up in the shop brb...

Jeremy
when is work over?
I am around this eve, and after 4pm tomorrow.
Jeremy
React bugs to kill:
1. get bug
2. absolute path issue
3. 404 bug

Can share the code with ya AFTER we like the debugging and testing approaches.
glad to talk ya thru the test case, run, tool eval
np
at your covenience
by squashing a few bugs, we can keep our getting stuck brief by design
And we ought to make a form which allows us to submit test cases and test runs 🙂
that ought to be our first form?
wish I had done it like this from the start
going back to drawing board and doing this right is best <sigh>
Calixte Sim
Ok around 530pm ill be available. No doubt im looking for a method in node.js that gets the heap size now. Im comfortable with debugging. Good way to understand a language and it's syntax. Like closing input and img tags, xml preferences here. The process is smooth.
Jeremy
ok
5:30 check back
thx for letting me lead a bit
we will make good time this way
prefer to do it WITH someone who I will work with than solo
Calixte Sim
Np
Calixte Sim
So I found v8.getHeapStatistics();
Jeremy
nice
Calixte Sim
but following directions it causes an error when i run
Jeremy
that sounds relevant
ok, give me link you were following
Calixte Sim
const v8 = require('v8');
https://nodejs.org/api/v8.html#v8_v8_getheapstatistics
V8 | Node.js v9.4.0 Documentation
The v8 module exposes APIs that are specific to the version of V8 built into the Node.js binary. It can be accessed using:
nodejs.org
on App.js page
Jeremy
you error out on:

const v8 = require('v8');

??
Calixte Sim
read a little. People are saying that you cannot run app js on front-end it is back end so I am at a road block
Jeremy
perhaps we can run this as express app....
np - will ask guru
client and server debug are both necessary
server-side = express
client-side = react
Calixte Sim
so server-side in not node.js
Jeremy
this something to sort out

react debugging first
then express
Calixte Sim
yes I was basically attempting to swap from that given in the example and that which would be provided by v8.getHeapStatistics() it returns an object of relevant data, at least that is my current assumption.
The value returned is an array of objects containing the following properties:

    space_name <string>
    space_size <number>
    space_used_size <number>
    space_available_size <number>
    physical_space_size <number>

best would be to walk forward form test case to test runs
and then we could test both tools
npm --inspect
did you use that?
Calixte Sim
yes

that runs node in debug mode

I thought I would have to use CLI but once again didn't have to with simple PHP. So  I'm going with the flow.

React Inspector
xyc.github.io
?
react first
then express
glad to work thru:
- test case
- test run
- execute test with http://xyc.github.io/react-inspector/
React Inspector
xyc.github.io
Calixte Sim
Cool please,because I am lost
Jeremy
np
at 5:30
<nods>
keep react first
then express
Calixte Sim
:(
Jeremy
np
my fault
Calixte Sim
things slowed down
Jeremy
we can work thru that
that is ok
5:30 no interruptions?
that is best
dont fret
see if you can work with √
http://xyc.github.io/react-inspector/
Calixte Sim
when you say work with
Jeremy
test it
Calixte Sim
I have a page display with there example
but no real data of relevance
it does display all data in data
but withot something to test against what is the point. I thought this was about what is in cache.
Jeremy
yes, thought that might help us
perhaps not
for example, react with router package should have all kinds of things
like web root absolute path
this is where I got slowed down
all predefined vars and objects
this ought not be a secret
and with every new node package, more ought to be revealed
http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.php
PHP: Predefined Variables - Manual
PHP provides a large number of predefined variables to all scripts. The variables represent everything from external variables to built-in environment variables, last error messages to last retrieved headers.
php.net
LIke php vars page
MOST important is to get all kinds of tests defined, first.
I am busy for a bit.
will free up at 5:30
Calixte Sim
understood.
ttyl
Jeremy
sson, yep
soon ^
Jeremy
will need an extra 20m (5:50)
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
if you do not have chrome installed, then install it
back in 10+m
Jeremy
k
can we define the test cases and test runs?
Calixte Sim
Are we doing this on gsheet
Jeremy
nope
in the repo
we are making two forms:
Testcase.js
Testruns.js
You think and spec it out
I will create forms.
TEST CASE AND RUN META-DATA:
TEST CASE METADATA:
test case id:
test case name:
test tool:
case designer:
TEST RUN METADATA:
test-runner:
system:
test-conditions:
timestamp:

fill it in like it is a form
in App.js:

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Tcase from '/Testcase.js';
import Truns from '/Testruns.js';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
you can watch me, gimmee a sec
Jeremy
k
Calixte Sim
I am here
how do you update git
I was trying to figure that out
Jeremy
nice
we will focus on react today
that is soon
1 sec
bear with me
2m max
then we play
k
here goes
k
Calixte Sim
<listening>
Jeremy
https://github.com/jeremy-donson/first-github-team-sandbox/tree/master/src
Look at what I did ...
three files
not ready yet
but heading there
see under src/ ?
We have App.js importing two components
Each with a form
Testcase.js
and Testruns.js
first we just want to see the components output in App.js
Calixte Sim
<following>
Jeremy
so, we already have working firstApp?
?
$ npm update -g
that updates all of our global packages
Calixte Sim
wait? no closing input and img tag will not cause error?
Jeremy
we wil have errors
we need to
and we will fix them
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
but we need to do this bit by bit
starting with something we know we can deploy
$ create-react-app firstApp
Could not create a project called "firstApp" because of npm naming restrictions:
  *  name can no longer contain capital letters
latest npm has new rules
$ create-react-app first-app
$ cd first-app/
$  yarn start
yarn is npm alt
I got the basic app running.
I would like to deploy to surge and heroku
but I had issues at heroku, build timeout
so we will stick with surge first
$ yarn build
just walking thru
and we will add the repo files in a minute
http://teeny-bells.surge.sh/
deployed
stop me if ANY questions
good checkpoint
yarn is new for ya
Calixte Sim
so Ill have to download it manually?
Jeremy
needed to cd into /build/ before $surge
it?
see if your node included yarn
if not, https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
Calixte Sim
no
it doesn't
Jeremy
k, first...
$ npm upgrade -g
upgrade all of your global libs
and then install yarn
https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
Yarn
Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.
yarnpkg.com
np - I am fine
Calixte Sim
scoop
Jeremy
surprised?  😉
I covered for package maagers
managers
Calixte Sim
Learning comes with surprises
Jeremy
np
but you are good
remember that yarn and npm both do the same stuff
so unlikely that npm would install it
scoop?  yeah 󰀀
do whatya gotta do
glad to wait
make sure you can deploy to surge after $ yarn build
$ cd build
$ surge
provide surge url
etc
Calixte Sim
think i have to restart brb
Jeremy
okidoki
not surprised
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
ok
1 sec
you built, cd build/, deployed?
if so, provide surge url
that makes it unambiguous
ie, I trust ya, but this is test-driven, so we make it about the facts 🙂
you there?
I will know to continue when you provide surge deploy url
Calixte Sim
Couldn't find a package.json file in "C:\\Users\\Sleeping\\Documents\\React"
Jeremy
What was the commend that failed?
that is just error message.
Calixte Sim
yarn build
Jeremy
yes
cd into project dir
$ create-react-app first-app
$ cd first-app
$ yarn start
$ yarn build
$ cd build/
$ surge
Calixte Sim
ok
doing now
Jeremy
looks like you were not in first-app or equiv?
cool

Jeremy
I am tracking tests which we need to write test cases for.  🙂  ^
All of that will be in our repo
I will know that you deployed when you paste surge deploy url.
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
I can be patient, but if you would care to narrate, I could assist.
and when you have error, include statement that failed with err mssg
k?
this is good
it is ok for you to be stumbling a bit
only second time <nods>
glad to be patient
Calixte Sim
thank you for your patients
Jeremy
np
Calixte Sim
Im just getting network areas
errors
Jeremy
not surprising
Calixte Sim
**
Jeremy
with surge?
Calixte Sim
no
Jeremy
please speak to attempt + fail
or I have no context
Calixte Sim
it is a problem. I am being throttled
Jeremy
well, without the thing you are trying to do, the failure has no context
help me out
=> ATTEMPT
=> FAIL MESSAGE
What are you attempting?
Calixte Sim
slow internet.
Jeremy
nono
Calixte Sim
Create app reinstall not
now *
Jeremy
ok
go thru it a few times, np
I got hung up on surge deploys after build by not being in build/ subdir
it is ok to screw up and fix it
Calixte Sim
thank you for the warning.
Jeremy
we ought to document the setups for Win on a web page for other devs
np
perhaps that can be your first payback
but meanwhile, I wanna take vanilla react app, deployed, and add some components
and have them render on main page
and then deploy those updates
go slow
you are doing FINE
Calixte Sim
deal
Jeremy
yip
now you see the goal
https://github.com/jeremy-donson/first-github-team-sandbox/
jeremy-donson/first-github-team-sandbox
first-github-team-sandbox - Here we learn to screw it up, clean it up, and then prevent it going forwards as a team.
github.com
reload
review what is new
tell me what you found
Calixte Sim
you placed test case and test run into a new directory.
Jeremy
yes, I am following the react app directory structure standards
and tests.yml
I am defining testcase and testruns as COMPONENTS
this is react dev 101
as I see fit
never saw it taught this way
but I wish someone woulda taught me this way!!!!  😀
goal:  push separate chunks into components
import them
render them
(y)
<Tcase...
<Truns
components become tags
and look at tests.yml in app root dir
Now, you have yet to show me surge deploy url.
That is checkpoint.  Worth waiting for.
Calixte Sim
daffy-robin.surge.sh
Jeremy
k, tested
now, look under public/
you will see the html template
good to know!
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
k
now you will clone the repo we are sharing to local
cd ~/React
$ git clone https://github.com/jeremy-donson/first-github-team-sandbox/
jeremy-donson/first-github-team-sandbox
first-github-team-sandbox - Here we learn to screw it up, clean it up, and then prevent it going forwards as a team.
github.com
Calixte Sim
If I have a clone already?
Jeremy
ie, NEXT TO the app folder you just worked in
nope
you never cloned yet
I have been avoiding git
and focusing on react, I believe
Calixte Sim
I did on my own 😁
Jeremy
ok
then cd into the dir
and $ git pull
I keep updating that repo on github
yours is out of date by MANY commits
Calixte Sim
done
Jeremy
k?
ok
now you have two dirs at play:

-  vanilla app we just deployed
- cloned dir
in vanilla app, rename App.js to App.-orig.js
just for being smart and safe about not overwriting files as a practice
we know that deployed, so keep it
then copy the App.js and the Components/ dir into vanilla app.
our goal is this...
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
With three files from cloned repo:

just trying to be VERY explicit
we have replaced App.js from vanilla app with the one from cloned repo.
And also added Components dir
Calixte Sim
correnct
correct
Jeremy
is the goal of this exercise getting clear?
if not, glad to clarify in plain english
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
k
Calixte Sim
im fine
Jeremy
good
now, open App.js
and look at the import statements
and let me tell you about an app where that gets ugly
after this, you will "owe" the barterEngine 2 tutorials:
- initial windows setups
- first tutorial with react.js
those could be react single page apps
why not?  😉
glad to assist
then you are paving the road for other devs to join and contribute
Calixte Sim
No complaints on my end.
Jeremy
yeah, good first assignment, with payoffs
now import statements are RELATIVE paths
both components AND images get imported this way, including svg and png files
Calixte Sim
understood
Jeremy
note that we COULD import Tcase as component, which could in turn import Truns as component.
Perhaps we will find that to be better.
First, we get this to work as is.
When there are DOZENS of component and image imports, and they are relative paths, we are begging for punishment.
Deployments seem to like ABSOLUTE paths.
:o
so, I am adding a test to tests.yml, which you ought to read now
and I will push in a sec
<listening>
Calixte Sim
<waiting>
Jeremy
pushed
so you need to $ git pull
 again
or you are behind by one commit
and we ought to try to $ yarn start
and see what fails, or not
in what before deployed successfully for us both to surge.sh
Jeremy

Jeremy
look
I added a bug on purpose!  😀
do you see where?
$ yarn start
failed to compile
Result above
now, in my opinion, seeing teacher fail and struggle is more important than seeing teacher NOT fail and look perfect
so, once you identify the file and line of bug, we can fix, save, and try to
$ yarn start
again
Calixte Sim
LOL
Jeremy
helpful?
we fail to show students how to fail and recover
not how perfect we are
that is not how to code
to code is to fail and know how to detect, fix, recover
make sense?
anything else you need, ask me
but reproduce the error I just had
and tell me which file, what line, and how to correct the bug 🙂
Calixte Sim
input needs closing tags
Jeremy
nope
you are guessing
look at error
reproduce error with

$ yarn start
ask whatever, np
Calixte Sim
my error says code not find package.json
Jeremy
make it about the facts
then you are again not in project dir
np
happened before
same issue
do not guess
reproduce my error
thx for speaking up

Jeremy
That is the error message.
Calixte Sim
I am not getting that error message
Jeremy
we have updated the proven deployed app with App.js, and Components/ dir from cloned repo
Calixte Sim
at all
Jeremy
ok
where are ya?
$ dir
Calixte Sim
yarn start
Jeremy
or $ pwd
on linux
nono, where on filesystem?
Calixte Sim
root of clone repo
Jeremy
nope
Calixte Sim
build?
Jeremy
hat has nothing useful

Tis shows how proven deployed app has been changed by:
1. renaming App.js  to App-orig.js
2, copying App.js and Components dir to proven vanilla app
this ^
we have two dirs at play
only ONE has been deployed
that is the one we are hoping to change, 
 and $ yarn start

and it failed for me, and was supposed to fail
I put a bug in a file for us
look at my error message
and call me if confused
call it my error in teaching
and lets getya thru it
Calixte Sim
we have "==" on line 14
Jeremy
(y)
and how to correct?
can you reproduce that error?
in which file?
etc
you are dealing with reproducibility issues
welcome to testing 🙂
Calixte Sim
Testrun.js
Jeremy
yes
first you need to reproduce the error
prove that is a fix
then you can update the repo you cloned, and we will give you your first commit to shared remote repo
is that clear?
at least in terms of goal and approach?
Calixte Sim
No lost at reproduce the error?
Jeremy
yes, I see that, np
you cannot reproduce yet
that is first
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
np
struggling with reproducibility is ok
tis a good lesson
I will not leave ya suffering for too long
Only ONE dir has been deployed.
Only ONE dir is the github clone.
They are not the same dir.
is that much clear?
very crucial distinction
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
VERY
good
then you can only $ yarn start
in one
and only $ git status
in the other 🙂
this is good for git in one
and react in the other
why pile them up?
you can learn both in parallel
you will need to reproduce react errors with got repo files copied into react app dir
no worries
I am not there.
So you are struggling to reproduce
And I am in part blind to your struggle
this is why you can call me or ask question
or $ dir
Calixte Sim
Not anymore
Jeremy
or sumthin
cool
datzWhadiymTawkinBout 😀
lol
worth making you struggle
good struggle
I am trying to make it JUST tough enough for you to learn without undue pain.
Let me know how this might be setup better for next dev, etc.
That is how this goes.
Tech curriculum design is not simple.
<nods>
You fail at struggle?
I failed as curriculum designer.  😮
I am trying to illustrate how test-driven coding and test-driven curriculum design can be done in parallel.
We are DOIN it.  😀
(y)
And we will suck less going forward if you narrate what of the struggle could have been more clued in while still likely a struggle?
this is how to train instructors AND trainees
both
Calixte Sim
Done
Jeremy
ok
did you reproduce the error?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
k
did you fix it in the react app dir?
Calixte Sim
yes

k, did it run right?

second bug!
Did that happen to you?
I put a bug in each Component file (2)
I am SUCH a dick!  😀
lol
Calixte Sim
copying fills now
Jeremy
explain
Calixte Sim
files now from git repo into vanilla react app to reproduce errors in vanilla react app
Jeremy
both errors?
Calixte Sim
that is the plan
it is the same error?
Jeremy
Look!

so, one error in Testcase
one in Testruns
and also one at bottom of file after export of component object
DAMN!
I fucked UP! 😀
;)
lol
you should get errors in same load order
Calixte Sim
my current steps attempting to get the files with errors you produce. with git pull/copy to vanilla app/ and debug
but i get same files
Jeremy
you pull
and then copy those into vanilla app
and run vanilla app
and should find several errors
== twice
and one bunch of extranneous text AFTER export statmt
which ought to be last executable line
Calixte Sim
I just pulled again it's response was already up dated. so now i will copy files
Jeremy
can comment out:

/* 
extrannesous
blah
blah
*/
good
always need the latest
I will make a change to repo in tests.yml and push, and you can $ git status

And see if you can see that origin remote is ahead of local clone
1 sec
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
ok
cd into first-github-team-sandbox
$ git status
Calixte Sim
ok I see some useful information
Jeremy
copy paste
it might be misleading 🙂
Calixte Sim
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   tests.yml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Jeremy
oh, have you edited that file?
tests.yml ?
Calixte Sim
no, not that I can remember.
Jeremy
well....
can always reset to your last version pulled
but that would delete any changes you have made in that repo
so...
$ git diff
see what changed
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
That is a LIE!
I just pushed
so you have 2 git questions...
what changes locally?

$ git dff
AND why is my push not recognized in git status? 😮
I assume that you fixed 3 react bugs, got app to run, and we can talk git for a sec
lemme know
if your react app is not working yet, finish that first
np
you could delete lines after export
or 

/*
comment
them
out
*/
brb
Calixte Sim
I only fixed two the list that need to be commented out and the equality operator
np
Jeremy
well, git pull
and I fixed those bugs
and you could have fixed 3, run app, and then added those fixed files to git repo and then:

$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Fixed 3 bugs'
$ git push
but i did it first
not you can pull my commits
see how team dev can conflict?
this is why nice team workflow is crucial
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
so, did you $ yarn start
and get app working again?
you could fix 3 errors yourself, or use the repo files after a pull which I corrected
Calixte Sim
yes
app is running
Jeremy
cool
redeploy
mine too
so I will:
$ yarn build
$ cd build
$ surge
send new surge url
make sense?
Calixte Sim
truculent-reaction.surge.sh
Jeremy
cool
now we simply need to spit out two components in App.js
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
http://immense-condition.surge.sh/
so, components become tags
Calixte Sim
understood
so our tags are Trun and Tcase. How do we use them correctly?
Jeremy
well done
lemme double check

yip
just raw content first
(y)
as expected
Sending you App.js file now thru repo
1 sec
k, $ git pull
and look at code
and use that instead to achieve screenshot about in app
see how screenshot sets outcome expectation?
good for reproducibility 󰀀
Calixte Sim
I pulled but nothing is different. Redo
Jeremy
you should see two tags in App.js
<Tcase/>
        <Truns/>
I will wait until you get the expected output in browser.
Calixte Sim
no opening or closing tags?
just one tag
Jeremy
self closing
/>
at end of tage
rag
TAG
lol
when there is nothing to put between open and close, like <input />
or <img />
can be self-closing
Calixte Sim
got it
Jeremy
cool
Calixte Sim
So all is needed here is import tag and insert them into app.js
Jeremy
import COMPONENT
Calixte Sim
import component. excuse me
Jeremy
and RENDER it as tag
just worth the distinction
this is react speak
<shrug>
Question:

Could I have put that content in App.js under render?
Calixte Sim
understood. in 5 years it will be something else
Jeremy
no components?
yip
could I have put both forms into single coponent?
yip
Calixte Sim
yes you could have
Jeremy
why did I choose as I did?
separating out components is KEY
and 1 to many relationship is two separate states
Calixte Sim
that defeats the purpose of using react and its components. Because they are for code reuse. All aspects of the app can now be separated in distinct pieces
Jeremy
each component has its own state
yes, that too
reuse is another way to make same point
<nods>
Case : Runs = 1 : many
now we are set up to thin about how to pass states between files
think
this bodes well <nods>
Calixte Sim
Um do you mind if we end here for today?
unless what is next is absolutely crucial
Jeremy
http://instinctive-dime.surge.sh/
nono
that is plenty
just completing the testing pattern of deploying at end
seems that our relative import paths held up
Calixte Sim
the smile the submit query button put on my face is something else
the = that
Jeremy
next is to play with node router package
that is how to add links
and the sooner we can debug the better
Calixte Sim
OK. I will send you the calendar and you can edit to your liking. I know you want to set a strict schedule so i will do my best to stick by that
Jeremy
meh
just either VERY early morns
or eves
not too strict, just regular and getting thru test-driven and gets and then posts
then express
think about 2 pages to create:
- dev setup
- first react lesson
worth paving that road
Calixte Sim
how complex?
Jeremy
simple
just for next dev to use and we support without having to narrate
and comment CANDIDLY about the struggle being organized and effective
ie, MOSTLY react 101
and a LITTLE git
and LOTS of test-driven repro stuff
I feel good about that from my end, but you can be candid about it from our end
your ^
might be wise to get into mocha and chai and selenium soon
automated testing
with proper debugging, we get bad ass quickly on that
mherman.org/blog/2015/09/10/testing-node-js-with-mocha-and-chai/
Calixte Sim
No I learned programming from some great instructors, though I do not practice everything. What you are saying is exactly their feeling towards development test as much as possible
Jeremy
but stick to paving the road you just drove smoother first
cool
pave behind ya
read up ahead of ya
and plan for some more get stuff soon
we MUST always redeploy to ensure that what works in dev also can deploy
Calixte Sim
Will do sensi
Jeremy
cool
I am just teacher
Guru is Kai
he just is too busy to run dojo 😉
Calixte Sim
No trust me, the value of your experience is priceless.
Jeremy
cool
thx
may my pain smooth your road 🙂
lol
Calixte Sim
But have a goodnight, speak to you in the morning.
Jeremy
k,ttyl
Calixte Sim
😅
Jeremy
thx
:D
SAT 5:08AM
Jeremy
next is to get your desktop and gitbash integrated
without that you are still in windows land
my mac is as linux-like as possible
we must do the same for your windows system
you up?
$ for n in $(surge list | tail); do  echo surge teardown $n; done
time you get you using the bash shell, and integrating that into yoru local win env
gm
I am out for most of the day, til about 4
but thought we should level set on what you can do to start paying back a wee bit, as well as getting setup to support the dojo for windows users
👍

Hopefully we can have learning sessions together, plus you can work solo on some small solo projects?

Jeremy
you will need to set aside  four kinds of time:

1. learning solo
2. working team
3. learning team
4. teaching team
5. teaching solo
Jeremy
Each can be 90 min sessions.
once we have terms of scheduling and barter set, you will find that you can teach simeon git and github in a test-driven fashion, and he can teach you react in a test-driven fashion.
the idea is establish terms of exchange:
- from me to trainers
- from trainers to each other
- from trainers to noobs
that is plenty
Seen by Sophie Chown at 5:28am
and relax, glad to make it easy for ya
SAT 6:40AM
Jeremy
get psyched - soon we will be designing barter api
not sure what language we wanna build that in
SAT 2:50PM
Jeremy
I am home now.
Calixte Sim
thanks for you patients
your
Jeremy
with?
Calixte Sim
we left off send information to the server last night.
with: waiting
Jeremy
np
we had a good phone call
Calixte Sim
Yes, we did.
Jeremy
fun stuff
x axis:
=> manual => test-driven => automated => AI
z axis => localization
that is juicy stuff
good for Sophie too
Calixte Sim
New frame of thinking for me, but beneficial.
Jeremy
list = 1 axis
matrix = 2 axes
we went 3d 😉
very meta
oh, and in addition to nAuth and vanished tactics
decoy is another tactic
as is invisible target
security tactics are fu
fun
decoy means they THINK they are getting the goods
and instead they exposed themselves
and get nuttin
all grist for the security strategy mill
Calixte Sim
hmm..... I'm having issue with importing images. I have done it before but cannot reproduce in regards to react..I was thinking of using a similar tact-tic like dynamic cvv. Because we still need to keep track of wallets, dynamic wallet? Maybe, it is similar to decoy.
Jeremy
worse than getting nothing, they reveal themselves,
 and might get busted hard and outed
look at App.js
import logo from './logo.svg';
then that is rendered ...
<img src={logo} />
Calixte Sim
brain fart thank you
Jeremy
np
components and images are imported and become
tags:  <Component />
and {objects}
respectively
wallet is important concept
what wallet problem are you trying to solve?
and csv is 2d matrix in open file format
I am data guy.
What problem?
Calixte Sim
There really isn't a problem. That is more of a credit card company old problem with static information. This is why bank cards come with chip to provide dynamic cvv services to card owners to avoid fraud. I am assuming dynamic security strategies might be a code way to go.
code=good
Jeremy
well, uuid in node is unique
long unique code
what you are pointing to is need for uniqueness,
without being obvious target of fraud?
paint the scene
👍
1
qualified user vs unqualified thief
here
if we have 100 qualified users, how many id's ought we have to keep them as relative needles in haystack?
ie, 900 decoys, 100 real id's
you gonna try to steal from that pool?
I would not even try to try
Calixte Sim
annoying for attackers.
Jeremy
well, let's make that more interesting
they are disclosed only by activity
so, suddenly needles STICK OUT
there goes that strategy, at least for now
cycling the decoys in and out of the real qualified users is one way to be dynamic and make the needles a moving target
that is one dynaimc method
ie, yesterday mr richguy was 12
today he is 7
is daily fast eough?
too fast?
how can we force the hand of attackers to reveal themselves while trying to scam against decoys?
and what kind of guarantees can we offer to merchants and to mr richguy?
helpful?
feel free to say NO
Calixte Sim
Yes.
Jeremy
k
lol
decoy and cycling is great tactic
frequency is an open question
and guarantees to merchants and mr richguy MUST be defensible
word?  😀
so, we may need to change strategies
and this idea of changing strategies
both predictively and non-predictively is plaguing me, lol
predictively?
easy
non-predictively?
:o
I dunno
y'feel me?
Calixte Sim
you can't really force an attacker to show his hand. Especially if it is a decoy. Maybe requiring Geo-location for all initiating transactions, but that can easily be spoofed.
yes
Jeremy
well, in order for someone to have ANY access, they need to either be a merchant or a qualified user
or on our team
no one else has access
single point of entry supports a closed system sensibility
three types of threat
merchant
mr fake richguy
and those on our own team
plainly I like this game and I want to win
and no one gets to play anonymously
no skin in game?
no play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPLDpJPaEr4
:D
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
let em come
of course we will lose some rounds
we MUST own the house, and make sure that the numbers are in our favor
or we are BEGGING for some tough licks
Calixte Sim
one step at a time.
Jeremy
good drama?  😉
indeed
Calixte Sim
i get the big picture.
Jeremy
yes, you do
decoy
vanish
Calixte Sim
but i am very simple. baby steps
Jeremy
n-factor auth
many strategies
Calixte Sim
2 factor is enough
Jeremy
depends upon their spoofability
I like 3+
and unpredictable combo
then they do not know HOW to spoof
mimic MUST know that which they are emulating
Calixte Sim
finger print with alpha numeric is unbeatable
Jeremy
deprive them of that
the most unbeatable is that which they are completely unaware of
NOTHING is unbeatable
and transactions force disclosure of mr richguy
and he wants security
but he sticks out like sore thumb on ledger
BIG ASS NEEDLE
that will not do
keep toying and painting scenarios
no scenario may be a surprise
or it will COST us
perhaps dearly
Calixte Sim
i thought you was removing ledger. bit-coin transactions do not display wallet address just a hash that is associated with it. I think this part is not public. I might be wrong.
Jeremy
ledger is important, functionally
could be private ledger
could be snapCoin with vanishing ledger
just worth toying with ALL options
no turn unstoned 😉
the enemy is thinking of scenarios which we have yet to conceive of
that is a liability
y'better believe it
and even customers who sign agreements may sue outside of terms of agreement and may win
so our guarantee MUST be less than our real integrity
NOT more, less
ZERO bs
less than zero
we may not take a bet which we are not aware of nor which we are not properly hedging
else we be screwing pooches in parallel 😮
Calixte Sim
lol
ok so no focus on the agenda?
Jeremy
how do I make sure that if someone kidnaps me, there is no way they get a penny?
right now?
we ought to review that list
and discuss x axis
tis a juicy axis
you get to either go through that list manually
else try to get test-driven and automated and ai with #1
or a bit of both?
ie, 2 axes in parallel
we will leave out z axis for now
I only have one brain 😉
the windows installer is a juicy thought
that is automation idea
test-driven approach would be wise
ie, always getting latest stable verion
Calixte Sim
ok, well there is no guarantee that someone will not get your pass if you are kidnapped better just give them your credentials friends.
Jeremy
nope
could be distributed
among multiple people
who are never in same state
nothing is unbeatable
not in either direction
no limit to stupid
and no limit to genius either
the question i which one will we be?
is ^
likely some of both?
:D
stupidGenius is a great name for security scheme, lol
Calixte Sim
😁
Jeremy
you are assuming that I have all the keys of the kingdom, and by kidnapping me, they get access to all of those keys?
how about we distribute that key?
including geographically?
Calixte Sim
if that is the case then it isn't possible.
Jeremy
well, let's just say that it would require a more elaborate plan to even attempt
Calixte Sim
what is this key for?
Jeremy
and how do I prove to kidnappers that I am not lying so they do not kill me?
key is for my wallet
or for the exchange as a whole
or for my daughters nether regions
anything I want to protect
Calixte Sim
:(
Jeremy
lol
just sayin
could be ANYTHING
lol
Calixte Sim
Understood
Jeremy
coca cola recipe is not known by single person
it is distributed across 8+ people
none of them are allowed to be in the same state at once
so I will call that the cola distrib strategy
lol
and now it is hidden behind a name that only you and I know
;)
do we keep them out
do we let them in and decoy
do we let them in and stay 50 steps ahead of them?
do we disappear the target, so they cannot have something that does not exist?
etc
I believe that merchants and our own staff would be the greatest potential threats.
"inside job"
Calixte Sim
all are good options except letting them in. but a lot of this is over my head waaaay over
so you'll have to slow down
Jeremy
k
can we change strategies?
this is the fundamental issue
Calixte Sim
everythings in a book somewhere
Jeremy
25 strategies we know
25 we do not
10 that are undiscovered
those undiscovered 10 scare me
will competition or enemies find them first?
A: 25 strategies we know
B: 25 we do not
C: 10 that are undiscovered
Calixte Sim
you go with the flow, cannot change what you cannot control.
Jeremy
we control it all
Calixte Sim
why beat a dead horse?
Jeremy
A => B is something we can plan
A => C is not something we can plan for
that is the real rub for me
A => B is shrewd
A => C is genius
howzat for boiling it down?
it is a live horse
and we want to keep it alive
Calixte Sim
solve the unsolvable= genius
Jeremy
nah
solvable
just unpreditable
apparently intractable != unsolvable
Calixte Sim
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import icon from './headerimg/header.png'


class DefaultHeader extends Component {

  render() {
    return (
      


      <img src={icon}/>




    );
  }

}

export default DefaultHeader;
importing this file as <import header from "path">
Jeremy
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import icon from './headerimg/header.png'


class DefaultHeader extends Component {

  render() {  return (     <img src={icon}/>    );  }

}
export default DefaultHeader;
now I can see it lol
question?
Calixte Sim
and calling <header/> should bring up the image correct?
I am getting no errors but also no image
Jeremy
<DefaultHeader .../>
and the file must be named DefaultHeader.js
and it must be imported by App.js as a component.
I believe I understand your quesiton
and that is the answer, but feel free to correct or challenge
np
and this is good recap from yesterday 󰀀
I approve!
Calixte Sim
the file?
seriously
😨
Jeremy
App.js would import the file named DefaultHeader.js
which imports image
renders it
and passes its contents to App.js in a tag
<DefaultImage />
SORRY!
<DefaultHeader />
Calixte Sim
ok clear
Jeremy
App.js imports component
component imports and renders image
word?
the speak is kinda crucial
and you could prove me wrong with code ad error
(test-driven)
but I think that is right
could you simply import image into App.js?
yes
Calixte Sim
wow. ok got it working
Jeremy
the use of a component and a tag is a recap of yesterday
nice
feel better?
Calixte Sim
just seeing if i can rebuild a php page I have
Jeremy
k
make a lesson page!
:D
Calixte Sim
that was the plan
Jeremy
or plan to
cool
repeating the lesson WHILE making a lesson is BAD ASS
might refer to that as reflexive
re·flex·ive
rəˈfleksiv/Submit
adjective
1.
GRAMMAR
denoting a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the clause in which it is used, e.g., myself, themselves.
reflexive learning? 😀
sounds good, lol
in fact, add that image thang to the lesson
first import component
then import image into component
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
so, you improved the lesson
and that kind of thing is barter back stuff
especially if you document the lesson!!
copy the readme
name it react-import-components.md
https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#hr
useful guide to readme formatting language called markdown
do NOT edit the readme!!!!!!
just copy it and steal from it
Calixte Sim
OK
Jeremy
and use markdown cheatsheet
screenshots are bouses
bonuses
[linktext](http://link.to.site)

![image](path2image)
link.to.site
link.to.site
unfortunately we cannot make an image a link in markdown
or if we can it is non-standard
# heading
* item
* item
* item
$ this is now gonna look like code
oh look
fb supports some markdown syntax 🙂
`
three backticks
code
three backticks
Calixte Sim

Jeremy
yip

Calixte Sim
`Hello
Jeremy
above and below
` ` `
Calixte Sim
`Hello World```
Jeremy
no spaces
nope
Calixte Sim
😡
Jeremy
` ` `
Hello World
` ` `
but omit spaces, lol
lol
Calixte Sim
`Hello World```
Jeremy
three separate lines
Calixte Sim
Screw it
Jeremy
` ` `
Hello World
` ` `
but no spaces between ticks
copy that
remove interstitial spaces
will work
Hello World
Calixte Sim
` ` `
Hello World
` ` `
Jeremy
yes, but
Calixte Sim
` ` `Hello World
` ` `
Jeremy
spaces are still there
Calixte Sim
` ` `Hello World
` ` `
Jeremy
keep tryin
3 lines
just remove spaces from lines 1 and 3
same markdown language for bbkt readmes
Calixte Sim
Hello World
ok cool
Jeremy
(y)
np
I had to fight with it too
worth it
images
links
code
lists
horizontal rules
---
three hyphens for <hr/>
the you are goog
then
goog is web for good 😉
Calixte Sim
Calixte Sim
I got a nav up...
bootstrapped
now search bar and basic stuff and I will be ready for input output
Jeremy
yeah, navs do not work like that
links are something else
using php as your guide is gonna kill ya, lol
going rogue is just a time-eater, though I am ok with your failing and coming back after failing, lol
I prefer you making lesson plans and we move on to next step
links are part of the GET lesson
lol
I put those lessons in order for reasons that are NO joke.
Calixte Sim
When is that lesson
because that is the only way we can us v8.getheapstatistics
Jeremy
you need to doc the prior lesson first
and I need to test it
and then we go to next one
glad to assist
makes ya learn markdown
Calixte Sim
ok no problem 😭
Jeremy
I will speed it along
else we will not be going back to the fundamentals I am afraid
but this is too juicy
lesson plan
review your grasp
next
makes ya learn to use markdown
too much bonus to skip, imho
we are developing rapport
further lessons will take less time
(y)
make sense?
and I will assist
just block it out
and I will add "guiding questions"
and we can always scroll back
Calixte Sim
exactly what I am doing
Jeremy
good for your skills and for training awareness too
and the speak worked today
that is rather impressive of us both
usually you would need to push, ask me to pull, define test that failed, ask me to reproduce, etc
no need, but that will be required often anyway
might wanna just copy it all out to text
what is name of the markdown file you will use in that repo?
Calixte Sim
Jump-starting React
Jeremy
use this....

k, no spaces
react-dev-jumpstart.md
or
react-dev-first-lesson.md
jumpstart might be for installs?
you tell me
just axin
.md = markdown
and no spaces, use hyphens
else fuxwith ghub url
lol
the word test appears about 150 times, lol
that might make one ...  testy 😉
Calixte Sim
no
Calixte Sim


Tenor GIF Keyboard
Calixte Sim


Tenor GIF Keyboard
Jeremy
lol
just mocking myself for repeating that word so much
Calixte Sim
it is imperative. now only thing is me adapting to your way testing
usually it is code, fail, fix , continue
Jeremy
I need that list of lessons
Calixte Sim
working on it
Jeremy
k, thx
I will add that to the readme
and then link from readme to your lesson
make sense?
test driven is fail first
Calixte Sim
understood
Jeremy
shweet
provide list
name lesson
I will add list to readme
and link to lesson
at your convenience
I think we CAN agree that this cements in the lesson
and you also added the import image into component
we could tack that on at the end of lesson
Calixte Sim
ok.
Jeremy
I enjoy doing the curriculum design collaborative-style
I like that lesson 1 was test-driven with regard to Testcase --< Testruns
ie, test case has many test runs
Jeremy
--< = "1:many"
class  --E types
very powerful data structure notation!!!
VERY
Jeremy
next we start to use momcha and chai
mocha
and look at other testing tools for react
why let issues pile up untested?
we  ought noe, imho
debugging
testing
paramount

Jeremy
we will read those together
and work thru them together
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
may seem circuitous
but it aint
not even a little bit
it will save us a TON of time
TONS
(y)
and it aint that much to learn!!
seriously!
we already are wedging test driven into lesson 1
tools for that into lesson 2
Calixte Sim
still writing the md should i be writing a script that just runs all commands?
Jeremy
nope
we can give that job to the next trainee
needs to train well
script skips the learning
Jeremy
I can work on it a bit tomorrow
so you can pass baton before polished
Calixte Sim
Ok
Jeremy
even drafts of first setup and lesson  = BIG progress
lesson 1 ^
how about we make a decoy currency 😉
we can name it.....
<drumroll>
shitCoin 😀
lol
base it on the price of poop
:D
LOL!
Calixte Sim
😔
how do i push git
Jeremy
wait!
Calixte Sim
i tried git push but nothing
Jeremy
need to pull first
Calixte Sim
Already up to date
Jeremy
good
then
$ cd [repo]
$ git add .
$ git status
$ git commit -m 'Created new lesson: react dev 01 readme.'
$ git status
$ git push
$ git status
tawk 2 me
lol
:D
can always remove fllie you created
discard repo
reclone
add file
and then follow those commands
or rename repo [name]-old
Calixte Sim
at least you can tell I am having issues
Jeremy
and reclone
pfft
gets repetitive
hard to get to that cyclical pattern
but WORTH it
$ cd [repo]
$ git add .
$ git status
$ git commit -m 'Created new lesson: react dev 01 readme.'
$ git status
$ git push
$ git status
see how status tells ya the state of things git-wise?
notice the PERIOD in

$ git add .
Calixte Sim
git pull https://github.com/jeremy-donson/first-github-team-sandbox
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
Jeremy
where are ya?
what are you trying to do?
use words?
Calixte Sim
sorry clone
Jeremy
ok
yip
np
pull is from INSIDE repo
clone replaces repo from OUTSIDE
all you did was add file
so easy to preserve and add to recloned repo
Calixte Sim
oooooook
done
Jeremy
can you paste list of next steps from above?
like those 7 next steps (y axis)
might scroll up like crazy and try to find string that is unique to that list
"DESIGN"
?
just helping you find it in web page after scrolling up in chat

github.com
And git pull
I have not reviewed your work in detail yet.
And I would say that 2 separate readmes might be better
1.  WIndows dev setup.
2. First react lesson
but that is easy
good work thx
after I review it I will speak up
after pull
$ git log
Calixte Sim
it sucks will improve.
Jeremy
pfft
helped you
not much help to me
but it will help next dev too 󰀀
Calixte Sim
exactly why I will improve
Jeremy
screen shot of forms will also help
yip
you get it
why should I review what I already know?
good practice for ya
and good use of git
and good to learn to make a readme
ALL good
Calixte Sim
Thank you. Useful skills.
Jeremy
indeed
good job with a LOT of new stuff
some guiding questions occur to me
Why encapsulate Testrun form to component?
SORRY

Why encapsulate Testcase form to component?
Why encapsulate Testruns form to separate component?
guiding questions are HOW and WHY questions
they help a trainee THINK while doing something new
were they helpful to you during the lesson?
Calixte Sim
Yes.
Jeremy
then perhaps you can think about WHERE to add them?
Calixte Sim
Where add them on the lesson?
Jeremy
yip
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
could be in the beginning
or the end
and some lesson stuffs:
1.  SSBAT
Student should be able to:
2. Expected duration (overestimate)
3. Any other guiding questions to kick it off.
4.  Author email
all in the heading
make sense?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
sweet
those are golden
imho you may want to create 2 headings
one for each lesson
and leave all that in 1 file for now
but you can so that tomorrow
aint gonna get built in a day
your call
Calixte Sim
Ok
Jeremy
I will do the github readme lesson with Sophie
you can omit all of that
😳 focus 😀
Calixte Sim
Ill work on it tonight. But have to go get something to eat right now. And then we are even 😁
Jeremy
I never said we are even 😉
lol
Calixte Sim
😨
Jeremy
but that was a good start
after the lesson is proven with Sophie, we are even
glad to getya there
of course it will work on me
I already know it
need a noob to test it on
then we know it works
you did most of the hard work, np
AND you learned to use a little git and readme formtting
it will flow faster for next lessons
how could it not?
just stay a good guinea pig for Sophie
keep sucking at git, lol
XD
actually what she is setting up will blow you away
remind me when you push so I can pull, thx
I have an express app which is like a chess clock.
We can use that for time tracking if that appeals.
👎
1
Calixte Sim
Lmao
Jeremy
Kinda badass idea
not necessary
but could be a strategic tool
can set many timers and only one user has the ticking clock at once
Calixte Sim
Sounds cool
Jeremy
great app
Calixte Sim
Disregard thumbs down
Jeremy
might even be useful
np
I will pull and work on those lessons in the AM
make sure that you push when done
k?
and now you are FEELING what the workflow FEELS like
and that is a good thing
they become cyclical
and when test-driven, are bad ass
Calixte Sim
will do. Thank you again
Jeremy
my pleasure
Calixte Sim
TTYL
Jeremy
ciao
SUN 11:00AM
Jeremy
you around?
I need some help today with python
at your convenience
Calixte Sim
I would have the time but that essay that is on the calendar is due tonight 11:59 been procrastinating for last two days.
Sorry
what are you coding?
and did it work on sofia?
the lesson I mean.
Calixte Sim
<listening>
Jeremy
hey
Sophia
Calixte Sim
Sorry
Jeremy
I will let you train her after you test me.
She will train you in git/github/bash
you will train her in react.js and express.js
no sorries
just thx
more professional <shrug>

Take a minute
I did not see that you had pushed
I tried to push
failed
was forced to pull first
which includes fetch and merge
needed to create merge log message
then I could push after pull
meawhile lets get you using baxh
bash
$ bash --version
https://superuser.com/questions/315195/is-there-a-command-to-find-out-the-available-memory-in-windows
Is there a command to find out the available memory in Windows?
I am looking for a command that returns the available physical memory in Windows. I tried "systeminfo" but it takes too long and returns a lot of unnessesary information for me. If there is not any
superuser.com
I wanna see if we can query windows hardware resources from bash
available ram total
ram used
ram remaining

disk total
disk used
disk remaining

swap things
we can do the python stuff after that
this goes to BASIC student prereqs
they must be ready
their system must be stable
and they need tools installed
THEN we can teach them techniques and workflows
comparing powershell to bash today for a bit first
https://4sysops.com/archives/starting-file-explorer-from-powershell-in-the-current-folder/
That helps
everything from CLI (powershell OR bash) is the goal
else not scriptable 😮
can we set you up with a .profile or .bash_profile bash config?
etc
how linux can you be, and when not, how to fall back to powershell
system resources
and dev setups for:
- chrome window
- gui editor window
- git project folder in file explorer
- command line with git in project folder
- command line with npm in project folder
$ mkdir ~/urbanspectra-projects/test-win/
oh
this is better:
$ mkdir ~/urbanspectra-projects/test-win/
$ cd ~/urbanspectra-projects/test-win/
$ git status
$ git init
$ git status
:)
Calixte Sim
Would you like me to just get a linux machine?
Jeremy
nope
why?
you will support other win folks
and we need to build an installer, where ALL of this is scriptable
you can test in linux using virtual box and ubuntu
but use win
make it linuxy
(you already did, we are just gonna see how far we can push that)
this is a gateway to the LARGEST population of devs on the planet
pave that road!
:D

Command Line Challenges on Win via PowerShell AND gitBash:
- chrome window
- gui editor window
- git project folder in file explorer
- command line with git in project folder
- command line with npm in project folder
ie script will query:

1.  do we have admin access?
2.  are we in clean empty account?
3.  can we install gitBash?
4.  If not, will we install all with PowerShell?
Jeremy
ie script will query:

1.  do we have admin access?
- YES:  create new account if not clean new account:
 login = URBANSPECTRA
 password = URBANSPECTRA
- NO:  Then they must approve install with 2 more warnings.
2.  are we in clean empty account?
- YES:  Give their primary account access to this account, read-only!!
- NO:  See #1 above.
3.  can we install gitBash?
- YES:  GO!
- NO: then can we install git alone and use powershell in vanlla acount
4.  If not, will we install all with PowerShell?
Jeremy
why am I doing it this way?

^ updated
Calixte Sim
What do you mean? I do not understand your question.
Jeremy
Well, you asked if you ought to just run linux
On server, yes
on desktop?
no
Calixte Sim
Oh i understood
Jeremy
We need three local platform flavors covered:
- linux => Sophie
- ox => ME
- win => YOU
and we all need to know about ALL 3
but OWN 1
and we could make this manually tested, automated, and plan AI trainer for setups TODAY
:)
Calixte Sim
Will not have time for all this today.
Jeremy
np
how about lay down tests first?
Calixte Sim
1.  do we have admin access?
- YES:  create new account if not clean new account:
 login = URBANSPECTRA
 password = URBANSPECTRA
- NO:  Then they must approve install with 2 more warnings.
2.  are we in clean empty account?
- YES:  Give their primary account access to this account, read-only!!
- NO:  See #1 above.
3.  can we install gitBash?
- YES:  GO!
- NO: then can we install git alone and use powershell in vanlla acount
4.  If not, will we install all with PowerShell?
Calixte Sim
is this a script you will want
Jeremy
well, will it run on ALL windows systems?
and will it be a packaged app?
1. manual
2. test-driven
3. automated => asking about this now
4. AI
like what if they do not have powerShell?
Calixte Sim
You will have to walk me through a test completely so I understand exactly what you are talking about.when you say tests. So I have a standard to follow?
then we cannot install scoop is there anything similar to scoop
Jeremy
correct
no scoop
just 3 options
1. cmd old-style
2. powershell
3. gitBash
test: are we on WIn OS?
test:  do we have admin acess?
test:  is powershell installed
test:  is gitBash installed?
test: can we run CMD
that is all we need to make this work,
and it MUST work for ALL windows versions....
and even if no admin password is provided,
we can have THEM agree 3 times to installing
gitBash locally in current account
Even one installer that works on ALL win systems...
That says Hello World
OR 
"Buenos Dias Monde"
would be progress
see, I went z axis on ya 😉
Calixte Sim
Lol
Jeremy
why not do 2-3 axes at once?
Calixte Sim
I see what you did there. Ok.
Jeremy
why not never look back?
WHY NOT!!!!!!
FORWARD!
TALLY HO!
:D
lol
I tend to move too fast
Sophie tends to move too slow
You seem to get a bit hard on yourself, perhaps impatient?
we will see trainees with ALL of those qualities
they are all manageable
we are allowed to be ourselves
and we are allowed to be human
gets us ready for all kinds of trainers and students <nods>
(y)
so, why not some xyz dev?
Calixte Sim
re-reading
Jeremy
win app, runs on all WIN systems, test driven, and spits out:

- Hello world
OR

- "Buenos Dias Monde"
np
xyz dev is about multi-axis features
x = features
y = test driven, after manuallt
z = localization, DUDE!
this is a project management workflow
your call
Calixte Sim
ok cool. we are working along x axis. Now question
Jeremy
well, xy is a given
Calixte Sim
what comes first because I am confused
Jeremy
xyz is a reach
for WIDEST AUDIENCE ON THE PLANET
Calixte Sim
are agenda just seems to be becoming larger
Jeremy
nope
2 axes or 3
single requirement
Jeremy
hello world that reports the following on ALL win systems:

1. cmd old-style
2. powershell
3. gitBash
test: are we on WIn OS?
test:  do we have admin acess?
test:  is powershell installed
test:  is gitBash installed?
test: can we run CMD
that is all we need to make this work,
and it MUST work for ALL windows versions....
Jeremy
then we can iterate forward:
- include z axis
- add system resource queries
- start bbkt private repo for this
Calixte Sim
so this is next task not lesson on React?
Jeremy
well, your react installer lesson needs to work for all win folks
we can do some react too
but this comes first
can do both in parallel
just cannot let lessons lag too far behind training
you should see Sophie and I negotiate, lol
she wants me to answer EVERY question she has
LOLOLOL!
15m lesson becomes an hour
Calixte Sim
OK let me finish writing this  paper and I will ping....
Jeremy
so I am developing ways to ensure that she makes progress too
ok
sounds good
glad to assist with paper
Calixte Sim
I am adding this on the calendar....
Jeremy
I am great editor
ok cool
well done
Calixte Sim
or you can, if you'd like?
Jeremy
I am not constrained
when you are free, gimme 15m notice.
I will be ready.
we can certainly schedule this week on Sunday
<nods>
Calixte Sim
Because I got a few things from here but more importantly an installer that helps any user of windows to get started with react is the goal, but we also need to get my system as close to linux as possible. Correct?.
yep
Jeremy
both at once, nice yep
1. bash
2.  powershell
3, cmd
ideally you are at #1 all the time
and can support others from #2 and #3 at will
and I have some python questions to solve

and then we can do more react
you ought to push me to review your lesson plan within 24-36 hours
but we are doing very well indeed
Calixte Sim
I actually hate writing papers,I tend to drift in and out of it.  shot the pythons questions now might keep from sleeping.
Jeremy
lol
not yet
will soon tho
format:
- question
- setup
- clues
- answers
Calixte Sim
ok
but I really have to get started ttyl
Jeremy
k, ciao
SUN 2:14PM
Jeremy
do you have an outline for your paper?
(test-driven approach)
Jeremy
show me outline
then I can help
what is your major?
Calixte Sim
No outline right now just textbook it is simple really
Jeremy
and what class?
best for me to know these things
I have studied many subjects
Calixte Sim
Computer Science, this particular assignment is not mine but someone paying for completion. I noticed your accomplhishment. One reason i asked for your help, can only learn fron exprience no matter from whose life that experience may have occurred.
Extra $$$
Jeremy
np
git pull
k?
One thing that I do that you will learn to follow:

?? means please follow up with an answer
So searching all text in repo for '??' is good for action items.
Plainly we will use bash and linux tools for that.  🙂
BUT
you will also need to support win folks there too
(powerShell + CMD)
Jeremy
please git pull
and let me know when we can do some python for a but
Calixte Sim
now?
git pull now?
Jeremy
yes
and then confirm that you did
I have no clue who pulls other than myself
ie: two issues
- git status does not mention when behind remote origin
- push from me needs pull from team, and no way to know
so we gotta keep in touch:

pull?
- confirmed

push?
- please pull
etc
look at actionItems file
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
(y)
so, say when pulled
and say when pushed after notification seek confirmation that others pulled
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
thx
Calixte Sim
i pulled
Jeremy
cool thx
Calixte Sim
do you also need me to push
Jeremy
acknowledged
not unless you committed locally
Calixte Sim
ok
Jeremy
no need to push unless you commit to repo locally
Jeremy
I wanna see if we can query windows hardware resources from bash
available ram total
ram used
ram remaining

disk total

Jeremy
Python:
- question:  
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

- setup:
An example and test would help.

 design a simple game, fix a coding problem using unit tests
2 more questions
1.  design a simple game
2. fix a coding problem using unit tests
pick any
First line of inquiry:
- which one(s)?
- why those?
- how would you approach these if you had to pick 2?
- how would you approach these if you had to solve all??
- what other questions do you have about these questions?
If time was limited, would you approach differently?
Why?
Calixte Sim
is this for a lesson?
Jeremy
yes
because we will use python at times
and it is my fave language
and devs ought to learn 2+ languages
three options:
- shell (bash)
- python
- node frameworks

Which do we use when and why?
would these be better solved with other than python?
etc
learning react and express is awesome, but shell and python are CRUCIAL for scripting
look, a cross-platform way to query OS flavors:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4553129/when-to-use-os-name-sys-platform-or-platform-system
MEANING, python GREAT for cross-platform scripting
even if bash never goes into a win system
Jeremy
At the very least, please schedule time thru the week in action items.
thx
Jeremy
Two good python answers:
- they must work for py2 and py3
- they must perform well,
else they must be discussed in terms of their bigO notation limits with regard to performance
Jeremy
I am comparing answers for py2 and py3
and I am writing scripts which work in py2 and py3.

Those scripts are GENERATED by bash.
Calixte Sim
BigO?
Jeremy
yes
this regards degree of complexity
and can help us determine whether we can improve performance
My bash script:
1. generates python script that runs fine in both py2 and py3
2.  executes those scripts 10 times in succession in  py2
3.  executes those scripts 10 times in succession in  py3
4. reports those times to two log files
5.  averages those times for each log file
py3 is WAY faster
WAY

works great
and inserting py scripts into the middle of the py2 + py3 timer script is working fine
After pull again

Add scheduled week times in actionitems.

ok?
??
please ..

After pull again

Add scheduled web/thurs/fri in actionitems.

Then:

$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Updated action items with sched4week.'
$ git push

Then notify me that I need to pull.

ok?

I am also learning to
generate python unit tests.

With automation efforts come the opportunity to auto-generate scripts and tests.  Cool stuff.

Python:
- question:  
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

An example and test would help.

What is BigO notation limits?
Jeremy
I am reading about it

I will pull and commit now. are the python scripts included in pull request?

nope
Calixte Sim

This is the model I follow while I seek to generate:
- python scripts
- python tests
- bash scripts
- bash tests
1. code
2. generate executable with parameters and with execution timers
3.  execute and save output to file
4.  report on output from file
5.  aggregate reporting
6. iterate above
7. improve upon terms of testing and automation
8. generate data sets that get more complex and larger, to see how #2 performs as data set grows
does twice the data take twice the time (proportional strain)?
Jeremy
this is what I am building
all generated and automated

Jeremy
thx dood
you will love it love it love it
Now, as we ADD to the size of the data set being processed
ie, does twice the data set size take twice as long?
what about 10 times the size?
can we split and parallelize that ?
is that possible given the terms of processsing
Calixte Sim
You are a python master so at times I think I am being tested. Yes you can parallelize them but does it not depend on the type of function you are running?
Jeremy
well, two things are limiting factors
and I am not python master, but i do like it
Ahmdahls law
factor 1:  is the set big enough where the split and parallelization bears time savings?
factor 2:  does the active set bear splitting such that the split sets can be operated on independently
Jeremy
do you want examples?
Calixte Sim
Not necessary. Still filling out action items trying to be fair to myself and you as well and  maintain manageability.
Jeremy
np
fairness is a balancing act
I know you mean well and have other priorities
Jeremy
we will negotiate in good faith

wow
I am getting SCHOOOOOLED in bigO and littleO notation by a true math genius.
oy, lol
he is being very patient withe me
Jeremy
"Although that only applies if you are going to draw from larger and larger data sets. If you're inputs are bounded all that matters is how fast it is for the size of what you are working with. So if I'm only working with 3x3 matrices I don't care if my algorithm blows up for NxN matrices as N--> infinity. I only care how fast it is for 3x3 matrices."

performance
I am looking at python problems that have performance limitations
and this is expressed in terms of bigO notations
three  options to workaround those limitations
1.  parallelize if possible
2.  pre-aggregate
OR
3.  use sampling to reduce set size
this is my world
either work thru, which assumes data set of limited size
or improve algo
or work around as above
Calixte Sim
.  use sampling to reduce set size
Jeremy
also, input data set can be not just BIG
assumes that it is a representative sample
and still costs time
and may require that we go back and evaluate how representative the sample is
all of those workarounds are tools in my belt
when a data set has low variance, we can aggregate it easier and most efficiently
data set:  integers from range 1-5 (domain)

Three sets of size 7:
1:  [ 2,4,2,4,5,2,1]
2:  [ 2,4,2,2,2,2,1]
3:  [ 2,4,2,4,9,2,1]
which can we aggregate smallest?
and wtf with #3?
falls out of expected domain range
I refer to data scaling as a "faceted" set of issues.
Not just "big"
many types of scale
many many
in fact those types themselves... can scale
:o
wanna see my list of types of scale?
I am DBA and data engineer of MANY years.
Was initially trained at columbia U.
This is why I wanna get you into SOME python.

Knowing which language to use and why is not small stuff.
I am making a clear case for scripts that can run in both py3 and py2
lots of py3 syntax was backported into py2
all of my scripts run in both
and py3 is WAAAAAAAY faster than py2
Jeremy

Jeremy
Scale is not just BIG!

Types of scale:
1. Size of data set
2. Types to data set
3. Data freshness
4. Data accuracy
5. Number of users
6. Number of requests
7. Number of servers
8. Number of locations
9. Degrees of complexity
10. ?? other?

I wonder if I could run python as a service
not launch off of disk
and then control how it uses memoory
that would likely be best for parallelizations

wanna talk thru the schedule?
hey

MON 9:48PM
Jeremy
you around?
thought we would plan thru the week
guess not
Calixte Sim
Yes
Jeremy
oh, ok
hey
Calixte Sim
So we have 4 days left..
This week
Jeremy
yip
should I work on those two lessons you started?
can you start a windows installer?
Calixte Sim
No,
Jeremy
sorry, not sure which that was a response to, lol
haw about speak to what can happen next and when
?
Calixte Sim
No need to finish the lessons i will finish them.
Jeremy
can be collaborative
might be good to add the transcripts of the chat to them
then I can try to work from the lesson like a guinea pig and see if they are ready for reuse
tha is what I have been doing
grabbing transcripts of my sessions with sophie
and she is starting to create lessons too
but the transcripts are the raw source
and the lesson is derived from that
the transcripts are like socrates
from live
the lesson is like plato
written
Calixte Sim
Understood. But a one man job should be left to one man. The installer, what are the requirments?
Jeremy
I need to think through the data generator I need to maake
it is collaborative
Even when you say finished
Calixte Sim
No issues.
Jeremy
needs to be tested to see if it is ready for new eyes
like a recipe
we cooked
we ate
it was good
Calixte Sim
Oooh
Jeremy
recipe?
try to write it
see if it can be reproduced from recipe?
like that
one person is likely not gonna do ALL that
of COURSE your sentiment is respected, and you ought to do what you can
2 lessons:
- windows dev setup jumpstart
- react first lesson
is recipe a helpful metaphor?
Calixte Sim
👍
Jeremy
so, do we talk about next lesson time?
I was hoping that you would have time to:
- work on lessons
- learn more lessons
- work on windows app
Calixte Sim
Yes
Jeremy
I can use XCode on the mac for installer dev.
Calixte Sim
Right now?
Jeremy
nope
It can make installers for all platforms.
It is bad ass.
XCode is free on OSX.
Apple was the underdog for a LOOOONG time.
So they are ready to build installers for all platforms.
HOWEVER, that does not mean that I can test it.
Just build it.  🙂
Calixte Sim
Lol no test is no good.
Jeremy
correct
but you test and prove the script works
and then I can add to xcode and you can run installer against various win systems:
- cmd
- pshell
- gitbash
- python
if you think that is messy
no
better than trying to support every win person that need help
WAY better
cover all use cases for recent versions of win
within reason
Calixte Sim
👌. I was looking forward to it. But not messy at all.
Jeremy
kinda cool
and better than a single script that works on your system and only certain other ones
for example, IF python is around
platform module can dish off ALL kinds of system facts
IF
if not, then powershell and cmd are our targets
or gitbash, if they will let that go in
so, of course
four example customers...
1.  says yes to gitbash, like you
Calixte Sim
One moment. ✋
Jeremy
2.  says no to gitbash, but yes to python
np
Calixte Sim
2 min max
Jeremy
3. has a more recent version of win, and user powershell

4.  has an older version of win,
and only uses CMD>
Calixte Sim
These are customer options or system checks?
Jeremy
these are four sample use-cases
"user-stories"
this covers most win users on the planet
no?
I was hoping for planning ahead around:
- work on lessons solo
- work on lessons together
- work on windows app solo
- work on windows app together
- learn more lessons together
Calixte Sim
We can
Jeremy
I was hoping to plan on Sunday for the coming week.
Calixte Sim
Lead the way
We can
Jeremy
I am leading
this is not a planned time
we have no plans for the rest of the week yet.
Calixte Sim
Installer is ont agenda
Jeremy
When can you work ok lessons (2).
solo
when can we review those
when can you work on win installer solo
when can we review that
Calixte Sim
Ill do lesson 2 tonight
Jeremy
and meanwhile, next lesson regards test-driven react tools:
- mocha
- cafe
- selenium
Jeremy
Installer Plan

1. See which use case a given situation maps to...
- Says yes to gitbash, like you
- Says no to gitbash, but yes to python
- Sas a more recent version of win, uses powershell
- has an older version of win, and only uses CMD>

CAN WE INSTALL ANYTHING, AND CHANGE THAT CIRCUMSTANCE ABOVE?

2. query platform memory
- total
- used
- free

3. query platform hard disk
- total
- used
- free

4. Query operating system flavor and version

5.  Ensure that there is sufficient space,
and get setup with github id.

6.  Perhaps do ALL of this in separate account?

7.  install editor

8. install browser

9.  scoop + node + gitbash + python
Calixte Sim
Please undate shared repo's action list file so we are not pinballing.  There is a section for current task.
Jeremy
there y'go
not sure what you mean by pinballing
nor undate
you can set times solo for yourself
Calixte Sim
Pinball machine, Ideas bouncing around
Jeremy
when setting times with me, those times need to be scheduled
so your solo times are up to you
would be good to know when I can review either lesson plan
if you want to schedule time with me, then that is up to us both
oh, update
nothing stops you from updating that action items file with stuff from right here
Calixte Sim
True
Jeremy
I was hoping for planning ahead around:
- work on lessons solo
- work on lessons together
- work on windows app solo
- work on windows app together
- learn more lessons together
np
not all on you
solo is just for you to declare
together is by request?
and sundays are good days to plan ahead for week?
monday is not awful
:)
Calixte Sim
Did you read the action items list?
Jeremy
I was hoping for planning ahead around:
- work on lessons solo
- work on lessons together
- work on windows app solo
- work on windows app together
- learn more lessons together
that is what is next
in each case, you can say:
what should I do?
when it is solo, you could ask for my help
but ideally you know what to do and you can get work done solo, and suggest when you will bring it back
and I can rebview
and I am not the taskmaster or boss
just here to help
while training, can act like the taskmaster
but not right now
k?
for example...
Calixte Sim
I will get lesson 2 to  you in the morning.
Jeremy
why not both lessons messy
and we clean them up?
transcripts is important source to retain
if not for those, going forward yes?
This is not paid work or a homework assignment.
Glad to assist.  And until we have ONE lesson we LOVE, this is unpredictable, no?
here...
1 sec
Calixte Sim
So my lesson 1 sucked? 😂
Jeremy
nope
just not finished
and authoritative would be to get transcript
Calixte Sim

Jeremy
and say:

Here is lesson.  I like it.

Transcript has a lot more, but I think this is max bang dor buck.
and we skim transcript
Calixte Sim
Follow this guide?
Jeremy
and decide if anything juicy is being left out
yes
Calixte Sim
👌
Jeremy
that is lesson plan format
it is nice and brief
we could skim that together
glad to clarify any and all
Calixte Sim
Was about to ask a question. 😁
Jeremy
I was hoping for planning ahead around:
1 - work on lessons solo:
   => Do you know what to do?  When?
2 - work on lessons together
   => Follows #1
3. - work on windows app solo: outline just provided
   => What can you test?  Can I assist?
4. - work on windows app together??
   => what can you test yourself of the 4 use-cases?
5 - learn more lessons together
=> next lesson is react.js with mocha and chai and selenium
Jeremy
there
that is better
skim that?
And glad to take a question
IMHO, quality is key first
THEN we can improve speed, np,
I prefer slow and good over fast and meh
I wonder if you would install python3 as well
and add that to the setup lesson (#1)
only if easy - up 2 you
<listening>
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.4
Calixte Sim
OkI have to reread everything, I was on my cellphone.
Jeremy
ok, that is not being available, lol
np
but this is why scheduled is key
I need to wake up ugly early
thanks for being honest about it
I will not hold it against ya
could be better 😀
Calixte Sim
Ok planning ahead: 

Do I know what to do? I think I have a clear understanding. The lessons need to placed in the format of the PLAN file
Jeremy
lol
yeah, we can skim that
and this will get easier with each iteration
Calixte Sim
There are currently two lessons that need to be completed
Jeremy
thx for the efforts
yes
what are they?
one of the most important section of PLAN.md = SSBAT
student should be able to
at the end, student MUST demonstrate and prove that proficiency
else WE screwed up, not them
(test-driven)
k?
two ways to deliver that proficiency
via curriculum
via instruction
lesson plan is curriculum
Calixte Sim
also we are building an installation package that will help win users get up and running with react based on the use cases provided. Meaning we will have to check their systems to see if any of the components are available and install them if possible.
Jeremy
and we assume the worst
ie, go with what they have
and do not assume that we can improve a thing
basically the opposite of what you delivered in our first session
which was great of ya
but we cannot expect that from iothers
others
we hope for the best
and PLAN for the worst 😉
Calixte Sim
basically the worst is?
Jeremy
and this is our first swing at a VERY large field of options
Calixte Sim
they cannot install anything
Jeremy
worst is that they have insufficient room, no admin password, and cannot install almost anything
in which case we try to see what we can download into their system and install into userland
perhaps after getting then gmail account and uploading stuff they can move to free up storage
and that person has old windows with cmd only
how is that for nasty worst?  😀
you asked!  LOL!
Calixte Sim
i stepped away for a moment and here we go
Jeremy
plainly those are not our fave
but they need to be considered and included IF possible
and this is all AFTER 2 lessons are written
ya?
so we might skim the PLAN.md
Calixte Sim
Ok....
Jeremy
and give you a chance to see what you CAN test locally
and then plan to reconnect about the installer therafter?
and while I review lesson plans, you work with me to improve installer pans
just winging it
to give this shape
you tell me
Calixte Sim
Ok I will update gitrepo now with our current task
Jeremy
cool
now
1 sec
1.  do we need to skim plan structure?
2.  do you foresee any blockers?
why am I asking?
what is the ANTI-pattern to avoid?
you have blockers
you do not see them
you are psyched to work solo
you set expectations
you get stuck
you start to stress
ANTI-pattern 😮
my job is to help you avoid ALL that by design
Calixte Sim
2. Send reminder with TWO links

- STUDENT-REPONSES.md raw 
- STUDENT-RESPONSES.md formatted
Jeremy
?
oh, that is interesting thing
Calixte Sim
what is this?
Jeremy
good timing to ask now
let me finish my point
and that will be part of lesson plan review
Calixte Sim
of course if task is lessons. ok
Jeremy
(y)
here....
PATTERN avoid the anti-patterns
first skim lesson plan
and you just threw a blocker at me
and I will address that as part of lesson plan review
then we ought to simply pre-flight the rest of your tasks to try to detect ANY blockers
metaphor
do NOT take the ball unless you know:
- where is the basket
- does the ball fit thru the hoop
take the ball and dribble?
why?
might waste time
and raise expectations
I find that an apt metaphor.
We do not get paid for dribbling.
Calixte Sim
cool
Jeremy
We get paid for points.
Oh dunkmaster? 😉
ok &
^ lol
SO, that student responses is BRILLIANT
4-5 states of student disposition
Calixte Sim
<listening>
Jeremy
bear with me
almost done
thx
Jeremy
1 I do not know what to do

2. Know what to do, but tools are either missing or blocking me.

3. I know what to do & I do NOT know how to do it.

4. I know what to do & I do know how to do it.

5.  I tried and got stuck.

6.  I did it, but I am confused as to whether I got the right outcome as we wanted

7.  I am good, and can prove I did it right, and I am bored.

8.  other?
Jeremy
here is the fun part
ready
?

lostya?
lol
you on the phone again?  😕

then we need an EMOJI for each of those
and that is how students can report their feelings of the moment
AND a bot could attend!
<dances a jig>
ie, a trainer bot could respond accordingly...
line x + emoji y => bot response z
Calixte Sim
wtf
Jeremy
now, for group training session this is bad ass
LOLOLOL!
trainer sees who is where and what they are up to, or how they are stuck
and for prompting a trainer bot, this is golden
you asked about AI
I am answering you 😈
all we need to do is see if those ~8 dispositions account for 80%+ of the student feedback
Calixte Sim
and all of this implemented where
Jeremy
not
Calixte Sim
o  ooookkk
Jeremy
and then assign emojis
Calixte Sim
student response
Jeremy
indeed
nice
thx
not simple
but GOLDEN
This is lesson planing.
:)
thx for asking!!
(y)
me and you and SOphie will BLOW DOORS with that shit
worst will be when 2 students are in diff places
will happen
this makes that scriptable
and auto-respondable
Sophie and I agreed that bot ought to be either male or female
Herman or Irma
lol
up to the student
they could query the bot
or wait for instructor help
you got this started
it is ALLLLLL your fault , LOL!
how is my answer to your question from saturday?
Calixte Sim
Clarification of location of implementation. because it seems part of the installer to me
Jeremy
it is monday 🙂
nope
installer is PRE-lesson
that helps us meet PRE-requistes
might config the bot as part of PRE-requisites
I would not conflate the two
installer could be run solo
bot is for trainer support
they both relieve us of some work
but in diff ways
Calixte Sim
ok this is way down the line
Jeremy
yes
installer first
then bot
1 manually
2 test-driven
3 automated INSTALLER
4 AI => bot!
Calixte Sim
ok...
Jeremy
I believe this wll gel
that is first
the gel
this is your first whiff
let it gel
Jeremy
1 I do not know what to do

2. Know what to do, but tools are either missing or blocking me.

3. I know what to do & I do NOT know how to do it.

4. I know what to do & I do know how to do it.

5.  I tried and got stuck.

6.  I did it, but I am confused as to whether I got the right outcome as we wanted

7.  I am good, and can prove I did it right, and I am bored.

8.  other?
Jeremy
get that into student responses
see if what is there is better or worse
and pre-requisites assumes that we are starting class with stuff installed
and we will show you how to USE it
not sit there and install it for or with you
that is why we need installer
let it gel
Calixte Sim
understood
Jeremy
SHweet
ok, no blocker is best
good to have a couple of things to work on
then if you get bogged down in one, you dump well-formed questions into chat
move to the next one
and this will take shape
Calixte Sim
Lesson 1 and 2 is the current task.
Jeremy
2 lessons is big help
yes
and quality first
Calixte Sim
ok just trying to not pinball
Jeremy
yip
now and next is key
what you call pinballing I might call setting the trajectory
but now and next are indeed key
Calixte Sim
Agreed.
Jeremy
you can always do that
JD!  Let;s stick to now and next!
we can push that to another day!
Calixte Sim
but knowing now helps me not be stuck on a thought later
Jeremy
np
yes, focus and clarity are great
now and next are paramount <nods>
if I had a lesson plan that was an example I would provide
once we have set that standard, other will follow faster
plainly the live training worked
Calixte Sim
Well are you available in the morning at 6:00 to 7:30 am.
Jeremy
tomorrow?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
I am booked from 5-8
Sophie has me then
that is why I need to sleep
can skim lesson plans at 8am
but would prefer to have plan thru week
short notice and unscheduled is hard
Sophie is finally scheduling ahead of time
Calixte Sim
OK I will review. and attempt to conform lesson plan to your structure. We have a task at least.
Jeremy
Sunday will beat her to the punch 😀
yeah
dont stress
iterate
schedule thru week
do not set unrealistic expectations
2 lessons messy but good is fine
you can make a mess and we can clean them up together
adding py3  to your system and to the lesson #1 is desired
your call
Calixte Sim
Will do. what about yarn?
Jeremy
yep
thx
good call
thank you for 2 great questions
student responses
yarn
yes yes
Calixte Sim
I was debating. But I will not keep you up. Have a great night.
Jeremy
debating?
prefer to not leave ya hanging if it is brief
Calixte Sim
I was debating on whether or not to add yarn to the lesson. you said npm and yarn are similar  so I didn't add it. I should have asked. That is all.
Jeremy
oh definitely add yarn
and py3
and think about how to run installer with reboot in the middle 😀
yarn required reboot, yes?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
so be it
not top of the list
but on the installer list
Calixte Sim
Last question. What language are we using?
Jeremy
for what?
lol
Calixte Sim
installer
Jeremy
for win, looks like we detect and use whatever runs
including .bat file if all they have is CMD
best would be python
but that is not a given
scroll up
4 use-cases
Calixte Sim
😑
Jeremy
lowest common denominator is CMD
I need to sleep
this was not planned
sorry
too late for me
I need to be up at 5
Calixte Sim
Honestly, i really appreciate this and cannot thank you enough. Good night.
Jeremy
np
ttyl
we will follow thru with review of 2 lessons plans that will need much improevement within a day
keep me posted
tell me when to pull, etc
6:19AM
Jeremy
I am working on Student Responses.
I will try to finish early with Sophie so I am free to review the 2 lesson plans.
And I will try to grab the transcripts from chat as well.
Student Responses is now called Student Orientation.
Jeremy
Let me know if you have time this morning, as I should free up by 7:30.
Then we could work on two lessons for 30m or so.
8:37AM
Jeremy
I guess you are not around this morning.
And we ought to review schedule for the week.

Setting tasks thru the week and trying to schedule them is just planning.

We can keep that super-brief,
but staying a week ahead you be great.
would ^
10:00AM
Jeremy
1. two lesson plans:
   - Dev System Jumpstart
   - React.js FIrst Lesson
2. windows installer
3. plan week
4. Next lesson:
React.js Mocha, Chai & Selenium
oof
I will spend about 30 min now on intelligent tutor and student responses.

Then I am busy for most of the day.
Not sure when we are scheduled for next working session, and prefer to be scheduled thru the week.
5:10PM
Jeremy
hey
I am freed up again
can we schedule the rest of the week and plan to schedule next week on Monday?
Do we want one installer script across all platforms, or one per platform?

This seems like it might be worth a brief call.  I wanna get that installer project started, and have it where we can each contribute from:
- win platformS
- osx
- linux

Best way to get machine id on linux?
What is the best-practiced way to get an unique machine ID in GNU/Linux for i386 architecture? Are there any good ways except the mac address?
stackoverflow.com
Getting unique id is helpful for single user single system.
Jeremy
The real rub is linux vs win,
so this looked interesting:

Facebook Is Testing Rich Text Formatting With Markdown
After years of frustration, Facebook could soon allow us to format our status updates by allowing Markdown formatting. As explained by Wikipedia, Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to convert plain text into rich text and HTML.
wersm.com
That is also good to know
where we can use markdown in chat
Jeremy
I am creating a subfolder in our repo which we will split off as a separate project... regarding installer.
Jeremy
gimme a few
you will like what I found
how was your day?
I will tell ya when to pull.
Jeremy
Not sure when to ask you about lesson plans to review, and expecting them to be messy.

Hope all is well.
Jeremy
the word here is "iterative"
Calixte Sim
Everything's fine i just pushed onto shared repo. Please read my thoughts. Its is based on plan.md.
Jeremy
ok, thx
you did 1 or 2?
Calixte Sim
Just question needed ans w ering
Jeremy
ok
will review now
thx
Calixte Sim
Will do before night end. How well do html work on .md files.
Jeremy
html?
diff medium
this is for those who do not want to deal with html
think about a software project at a biz or org
non-dev gets tasked to do docs
that is what markdown is used for
do I hate markdown?
YES!
:D
lol
meanwhile, github PAGES can be html
but this is just a readme
the focus is on doc INSTRUCTIONAL structure
<listening>
https://developers.google.com/style/markdown
Calixte Sim
Also review action list .please confirm accuracy on current task for the week edit if you like.
Jeremy
of course
should I do that first?
Calixte Sim
No
Jeremy
ok
thx
no reason needed
just asking
Calixte Sim
Question i have are plenty i think. Excuse me if i am moving to slow
Jeremy
nope
no need
quality first
THEN pace
you will find that I am fine with quality going UP
even slowly at first
I am stupid like that 😉
it is the voice of experience speaking
faster without high quality?
meh
:D
I am learning too
np
Calixte Sim
Student response.md in repo is instruction for gui story
??
Jeremy
Unclear question.
rephrase?
np
just clarify
oh, gui story is GREAT scenario
thx for that
what are you asking about it?
and there are a few scenarios
gui-only
markdown author
dev
you are correct to look at it that way
Calixte Sim
Is the content in the student-response.md file an outline for a users story?
Jeremy
I improved massively
we need to start a trainer repo
and setup something common to all lessons
then we can make that a sub repo of EVERY lesson
sense?
Calixte Sim
👎
Jeremy
lesson plan
k
Calixte Sim
No
Jeremy
np
no like you do not understand yet r you do not agree?
or ^
either are fine
Calixte Sim
Don't understand
Jeremy
k
this comes up in two ways....
Calixte Sim
😶
Jeremy
gimme a sec
easy one
1.  when someone makes 2+ lessons, what does each lesson have in common?

2.  across syllabi and entire tracks of learning, this curriculum developer repo is common to ALL
student responses is an example of that common repo
this happens
two lessons two repos
common third repo
"subrepo"
Calixte Sim
Oh 👌
Jeremy
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4500305/git-repository-within-git-repository
at first with git it was was submodule
THAT WAS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE
scope down by searching on the word "tree"
git tree is sweet
we are creating a tree
how organic 🙂
;)
go slow
I am good
this is HUGE
We can be VERY rigorous about what 2 lessons might have in common.
That third repo is subrepo, and git module is NOT recommended
git tree IS recommended
glad to wait
np
good leap!
Calixte Sim
Big
Finished reading?
Jeremy
I will do that now
go slow
so, we create third repo
and we start to shuffle common things across lessons to that repo
you go ahead and read
not submodule
tree
k
https://bitbucket.org/jjdonson/dojo-training-nexus
Bitbucket
bitbucket.org
I will add you to that repo as contributor.
simeoncalixte
yes?
Calixte Sim
👌
Jeremy
k
https://bitbucket.org/jjdonson/dojo-training-nexus
Bitbucket
bitbucket.org
it is empty
but we will  manage it as the "trunk" of a "tree"
now, repo in repo creates some issues to deal with...
there the pull
and there is the "sub-pull"
lessons get the pull
dojo-training-nexus gets the "sub-pull"
ie, when we update a lesso, we pull
lesson
when we update the nexus, we "sub-pull)
this regards where we are when we pull
ask whatever
worth a brief "pinball" 😉
git submodule is still an option
HIGH maintenance
zero payoffs
Calixte Sim
Jeremy
lol
good stuff?
so, imagine we cloned something AWESOME from ghub, which we need for project x
Calixte Sim
No <listening> the link you sent mentioned this
Jeremy
it lives IN project x
yep, lol
so OUR project x DEPENDS upon remote project y from someone else
sense?
ie, that makes sense?
we are doing this to ourself, but can happen in other ways too
Calixte Sim
Yes.. I didn't know it was remote
Jeremy
np
it?
which it?
help me with that pronoun
just restate without pronoun
Calixte Sim
The remote projectct that goes into our sub-git repo
Jeremy
oh, we could start it all locally
and work in two repos side by side
and then realize that one depends upon the other
or we could have stuff in one repo that is common two two repos, which is what happened to us
or we could have a project which depends upon repo we do not own
so far we OWN all repos
all use-cases drive us towards use of repo-in-repo solution
tree is best method
hit me when you feel better about this
Calixte Sim
Im not confused.
Jeremy
nice
Calixte Sim
Im just reading
Jeremy
np
new hting
thing
VERY helpful to learn about dealing with dependencies
when we have dependencies
Calixte Sim
I got your invite on bit bucket
Jeremy
cool
clone that sucker as a sibling repo
sibling ...
Calixte Sim
:)
Jeremy
/path/to/bro1/
/path/to/bro2/
sense?
they are not yet TREE'D
soon then will be
now, fyi, why not a soft link?
wtf?
why tree?
/path/to/bro1/
/path/to/bro2/

then we just...
$ ln -s /path/to/bro2/ /path/to/bro1/bro2/
linux speak
soft link = shortcut or folder alias
why tree?
good question!!!!!
deal with the prposition
why impose complexity?
make git ignore soft links
let them live APART
why make the bros get all dependent?
either COULD work, to a degree
so this is healthy counterpoint
I will give you a sec to acknowledge my question
and speak to why each choice is an option
and why I strongly vote for git tree to track deps where possible
this is a "decoupling" problem
I am making a case for REcoupling
why?
Calixte Sim
I have no clue
Jeremy
after 15+ years decoupling as an engineer
why is decoupling often good?
then this exception can be made without screwing you up going forward lol
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)#Disadvantages
I want to couple this.
take your time
I am too good a teacher to play this wrong.

:)
uml
how is your brain?
rule:  decouple where possible
exception:  couple when necessary
?
Calixte Sim
Ok, so why do you want to couple the repo's?
Jeremy
k?
Calixte Sim
To ensure that all components work?
still not sure?
????
Jeremy
they are necessarily dependent
this is not a child that lives without the parent
Calixte Sim
Understood
Jeremy
that child is needed IN that parent
Calixte Sim
so I asked the right question 🙂
Jeremy
else that parent is BLIND
yes
you were clear and on point
and UML does the dashed arrow, which should be how tree "says" this, imho
classic case of coupling
due to mandatory dependency
I gave you a few use-cases
they are worth chewing over for a sec
three of them
1.  convergent owned
2.  divergent owned
3.  dependent not owned
we just diverged a common repo across all lessons!
we own ALL that shit
#2 case
if we found lesson plan structures  on ghub we might fit case #3
ie, what if the maintainer of that dependent not owned remote improved that repo that we do not own?
we have the OPTION of pulling or not
it is the opposite of a pull request

we might call it a push offer 😉
we can accept that offer, or decide not to sub-pull
simple diagram would make this clean
also, if we wanted to do ALL of our lessons in a single repo, we could do that with BRANCHES
cross-repo? tree
within-repo?  branches
Calixte Sim
Understand
Jeremy
now you are up on the talk
it is organic
root
tree
branch
:o
gardener talk, lol
:D
suggestive terminology
Calixte Sim
Exactly
Jeremy
so
let me drop bro1 INTO bro2
and tell you what I am doing
NOT soft link/folder alias
tree, to reflect the dependency
after this, you can have 2 separate lessons, with nexus in each, common to both
sense?
1 sec
easy to do
and I will narrate
if we had 25 devs making lessons out there, we might pass this repo thru all of them, to GATHER the resources common to ALL lessons
"nexus?
nexus
[nek-suh s] 
Spell  Syllables
Examples Word Origin
See more synonyms on Thesaurus.com
noun, plural nexuses, nexus.
1.
a means of connection; tie; link.
2.
a connected series or group.
means what it is
1 sec
Calixte Sim
Cook
Cool
Jeremy
ok, I pulled
I worked in a file of a diff name on purpose
nice trick to avoid pull overwrites  🙂
STUDENT-ORIENTATION.md
new name
impossible to overwrite, unless you made a file out of the clear blue sky of that name and committed it and pushed
please pull
let me narrate so you glean the clarity of what I am doing as I do it
Calixte Sim
oookkkk
Jeremy

look at what i have
you can see that I pulled
and your file is there?
two things I want to move into lesson nexus common repo
folder:  x-platform-installer-framework
file: STUDENT-ORIENTATION.md
we will likely have a WHOLE separate project for that installer, but my point is set clarify what is in nexus and what is in DEPENDENT lesson folder
ask whatever
np
Calixte Sim
ok I pulled
Jeremy
ok
then you can see for yourself
have you clones the nexus project?
cloned
NEXT to our repo
siblings
Calixte Sim
doing now
Jeremy
cool
/path/to/bro1/
/path/to/bro2/
right?
after clone?
I will start to review the lessons
and you set the pace for me
np
Calixte Sim
Um have to reset password. it is not working
Jeremy
which?
it?
Calixte Sim
bitbucket
Jeremy
you are invited to repo
that was confirmed, no?
therefore you ought to be able to clone and push
np
just confirm that I understand you error
your
Calixte Sim
Yes
but when I pull my password is not actually valid
clone I mean
Jeremy
hm
Calixte Sim
So I am trying to reset
Jeremy
you can reset via email
np
new pass
just have it match github, or you will go insane, lol 😀
whatever you set, match bbkt and ghub
too worth it
Calixte Sim
got
got it
Jeremy
goot
lol
I am ready 4ya
Calixte Sim
I used google to authenticate so I did not have a set password. with bit bucket
Jeremy
ok
Calixte Sim
Go ahead
<listening>
Jeremy
cool
ok, so we will start to pull both soon

Jeremy
ok, now I did it right
I committed in subrepo first
THEN I can commit in parent repo with embedded SUB commits in nexus
ok
Calixte Sim
So always commit children first?
Jeremy
you should be able to pull both at once
from parent
commit inner child changes first
and push them!
then step out to parent
$ cd ..
and then $ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Changing parent repo after child repo has new commits'
git push
and now all is good from my end
you should JUST pull from parent and see it ALL with single pull from parent
therefore, all of this could have been kept transparent to you
BUT you are working on 2 lessons
and you might update nexus from either
you can toss it all and clone parent and you would get it all
but now you know what I did, why, and hot to contribute to nexus sub repo
how ^
ask whatever
that was juicy
Calixte Sim
Learned something new.
Jeremy
indeed
and now instead of just contributing to a lesson
you can contribute to the lesson nexus
Calixte Sim
So, Plan.md?
Jeremy
k, I am answering your questions
yes
that was left for you to do
when you are ready
1 sec
about to push
k
pull first
then look at

$ git log
looks like 2 files should go to nexus subrepo
and then commit to sub
subpush
👍
1
and then commit to parent repo
push
feel free to hit me with a WTF? 😀
no rush
always GREAT to skim git log and see what messages tell ya since last commit and push
Jeremy
in response to your question:

important distinction:
- Student prerequisites: Must ALL be met before we start the lesson.
- Student Should Be Able To (SSBAT):
- => Must ALL be understood at the beginning of the lesson by the student.
- => Must ALL be PROVEN as task proficiencies by the student at the end of the lesson.

Jeremy
lostya?
;)
It is not even 10
Calixte Sim
Understood, before cand after
Jeremy
yes
PRIOR and before and after
PRErequisites
then cannot arrive to class without system setup
Calixte Sim
Oh crap you reminded me. I have to pick up my mother @ 10
Jeremy
np
mom is important
lo;
lol
good I spoke up
do NOT leave Mom hangin!
:D
LOL!
Calixte Sim
She would of been pissed
Jeremy
well now she likes me 😉
lol
better would have been for you to speak to your next deadline
np
for the future
you lucked out
Calixte Sim
So is javascript considered a  prerequisite?
Jeremy
for react?
not for setup
for lesson 1?
Calixte Sim
O ok
Jeremy
yes for trainer for lesson 1
NO for student for either
you can say BUT WHY?
after you return with mom 😀
these are STELLAR quesitons
Calixte Sim
Exactly. Edit the action items if you like as well.
Jeremy
I will continue with your quesitons doc in your absence
and you have 2 files to move into nexus when you return AFTER you pull
k?
Jeremy
ok, single pull should update both from parent
ie, pull, not sub-pull.
k
pull fro parent
$ git log
I am starting to leave you next step messages in git log
Calixte Sim
Ok
Jeremy
hey
so you know what I did
not you get to do the same thing by moving two files from parent to subrepo
commit to subrepo first
push
then commit parent repo
push
did you tell mom that were it not for me, she would have been left hangin' ?
😀 lol
speak up
? => git log notes
? => moving two files into nexus
? => commit to subrepo
? =? push subrepo
? => commit to parent repo
? =? push parent repo
?
k?
worst case, just rename the parent with subrepo and reclone
the radio silence is getting eerie, lol
hey
Calixte Sim
Didn't pick her up, driving.
Jeremy
ok
cool
thx
now I get it
lol
Calixte Sim
She says thank you.
Jeremy
lol
<hatTip> 😉
Calixte Sim
15 to 20 min max. Spill all details in md.
Jeremy
I sent my updates
you just need to follow thru when you return

drive safe. np

? =? push subrepo
? => commit to parent repo
? =? push parent repo
Jeremy
I was up at 5
Would be nice to go back and gather the transcripts..
Perhaps I ought to do that?
Calixte Sim
Copy and paste?
Jeremy
sorry?
you have returned?
Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
k
Calixte Sim
i just pulled
Jeremy
look at  $ git log
in parent repo
you should be able to discard sibling nexus project clone
as, now that folder is a subrepo after pull
?
speak up?
I need to get to sleep.
Calixte Sim
can i see a copy of your directory structure
Jeremy
yes

Calixte Sim
thank you
Jeremy
np
fair Q
Calixte Sim
Had it wrong
Jeremy
no biggie
you are doing pretty well for flying blind
once you have it righr
right:
lemme know when you have it right
ok, I have no clue what you are doing or trying to do
some narrations would help
Calixte Sim
did not place the  child-repo in the parent repo. It is currently a parent-repo itself
Jeremy
k, then move it in there
this is dragging
I am in serious need of sleep
Calixte Sim
sleep
Jeremy
can't
we need to review what I updated
move that nexus folder into parent
Then in parent folder

? => git log notes
? => moving two files into nexus
? => commit to subrepo
? =? push subrepo
? => commit to parent repo
? =? push parent repo
ball will end up back in your court before I sleep
Calixte Sim
what files am i moving exactly
Jeremy
that is second
first match the directory structure as my screen shot
Calixte Sim
that is done
Jeremy
move subrepo into parent folder
then follow list above
Then in parent folder

? => git log notes
? => moving two files into nexus
? => commit to subrepo
? =? push subrepo
? => commit to parent repo
? =? push parent repo
Calixte Sim
any file
?
ok
Jeremy
no
two in particular
this is new to you, but they are kinda obvious
Calixte Sim
lesson 1 and 2
:)
Jeremy
nope
Calixte Sim
:(
Jeremy
did you pull in subrepo?

Calixte Sim
yes
Jeremy
how would I know?
no narrations
I would not guess
log at $ git log
