What does blank line mean in markdown code block above?

Please do those one at a time  And comment in order.

Brief comments or questions, please?
If I ask for output, paste only that command output.

We do NOT want students to push in this lesson at all.

Just local stuff.  And git pulls. ONLY



that would mean a difference between command which queries locally (top) from a command which contacts the bitbucket server? 'git pull'?
like a way to get someone to 'pause'

Blank line in markdown code block says:
"There is more stuff coming up, so make sure you got everything together for the next part."
But that's just my guess.


Yes:  "Stop, ensure you did not fly thru with errors behind ya.
Reflect on what you see as commend output."

It is a 'reflective checkpoint' for a student
